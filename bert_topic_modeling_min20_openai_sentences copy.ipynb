          "The cost of slop to libraries is serious, Sullivan said, “not just the cost of the books” but the cost of labor: It takes cataloguers longer to do their jobs when they’re wading through “an outpouring of valueless product.” Human artists, writers, journalists, musicians, and even TikTokers have more work to do too, competing not just with other humans but with the passable products of automated systems.",
          "The only way librarians can limit what Hoopla books their customers can borrow is by setting a limit on the price of books.",
          "Public libraries primarily use two companies to manage and lend ebooks: Hoopla and OverDrive, the latter of which people may know from its borrowing app, Libby.",
          "Attempting to read news online is now fraught with the possibility that you’re consuming unedited AI-generated tattle: CNET, BuzzFeed, USA Today, and Sports Illustrated have published stilted and often incorrect AI-generated articles or used phony images and biographies for “authors.”\nImagine you are going foraging and want to download to your Kindle a guide to distinguish between edible and toxic mushrooms.",
          "On one hand, Hoopla’s gigantic catalog, which includes ebooks, audio books, and movies, is a selling point because it gives librarians access to more for cheaper price.",
          "So is a low-price digital book that seems like the one you were looking for, but not quite.",
          "A prominent example came when amateur mushroom pickers were recently warned to avoid foraging books sold on Amazon that appeared to have been written by chatbots and contained dangerous advice for anyone hoping to discern a lethal fungus from an edible one.",
          "On the other hand, making librarians buy into the entire catalog means that a customer looking for a book about how to diet for a healthier liver might end up borrowing Fatty Liver Diet Cookbook: 2000 Days of Simple and Flavorful Recipes for a Revitalized Liver.",
          "A key difference is that with OverDrive, librarians can pick and choose which books in OverDrive’s catalog they want to give their customers the option of borrowing.",
          "For example, a library can use Hoopla but make it so their customers can only borrow books that cost the library $5 per use.",

          "Forager’s Harvest 101 has an intelligibly (if cheaply) designed cover and legible (if smooth and voiceless) prose as well as an author biography featuring a photo of a smiling middle-aged woman.",
          "If you look on Amazon, you’ll turn up some obviously legitimate books.",
          "Both companies have a variety of payment options for libraries, but generally libraries get access to the companies’ catalog of books and pay for customers to be able to borrow that book, with different books having different licenses and prices.",
          "Low quality books that appear to be AI generated are making their way into public libraries via their digital catalogs, forcing librarians who are already understaffed to either sort through a functionally infinite number of books to determine what is written by humans and what is generated by AI, or to spend taxpayer dollars to provide patrons with information they don’t realize is AI-generated.",
          "Though he first noticed the problem thanks to a recipe book by a nonexistent author that featured “a meal plan that told you to eat straight marinara sauce for lunch,” the slop books he sees often cover highly consequential subjects like living with fibromyalgia or raising children with ADHD.",
          "The digital media provider Hoopla, which supplies libraries with ebooks and downloadable content, has generative AI books with fictional authors and dubious quality, which cost libraries money when checked out by unsuspecting patrons.",
