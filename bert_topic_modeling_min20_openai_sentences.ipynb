          "— Luas (@Luas) October 31, 2024\nOn Thursday evening, a Google search of \"Dublin Halloween parade\" returned a top result for a website called MySpiritHalloween.com.",
          "\"All trick no treat - \"Hoax\" Halloween parade draws big crowds to Dublin's O'Connell St\".",
          "Someone did pull a big #hoax #Prank pic.twitter.com/zTQUShZrya\n— Artur Martins (@arturmartins) October 31, 2024\nAnother X user, @liam_b02, shared a clip of the crowds on O'Connell Street taken from a passing bus:\nO’Connell street filled with people waiting for a fake parade #dublin pic.twitter.com/ROteZMGeUp\n— liam (@liam_B02) October 31, 2024\nMeanwhile, the Luas was disrupted due to the unexpected gathering, with Red Line services not running from from Smithfield to The Point and Green Line services not running between St. Stephen's Green and Dominick.",
          "While there was no Halloween parade on Dublin's O'Connell Street, locals and visitors alike were spoiled for choice for Halloween happenings with several events organized by Dublin City Council.",
          "That’s it.",
          "A spokesperson said: “Please be advised that contrary to information being circulated online, no Halloween parade is scheduled to take place in Dublin city centre this evening or tonight.",
          "“But I’d signed the contract, and part of me didn’t want to disappoint the kids going to this.” Similarly, Connell felt bad for the children subjected to Willy’s Chocolate Experience.",
          "That would be very simple, but we didn't even mention the ticket thing.",
          "In the past the site had removed non-existent events when contacted by their venues, but in the case of the Dublin parade the site owner said that \"no one reported that this one wasn't going to happen\".",
          "Paul Connell, a stand-up comedian who was hired to play Willy himself, took to social media to explain how he got caught up in the whole mess.",
          "It turns out you can’t arrest someone for providing a shamefully underwhelming event.",
          "He said it quickly dawned on him “because parades usually have barricades, security, police and some sort of organisation” and he could see no evidence of that, just “vast amounts of people”.",
          "In one city, it was the power of a phony online event listing.",
          "It's going really well.",
          "What did the organizers of the event have to say for it?",
          "It was almost like they were secondhand.” Jenny Fogarty, who also played an Oompah Loompa, told The Scotsman that “the wigs were very cheap.",
          "What happened at the event?",
          "'No criminal offences'\nA Garda spokesperson said the event will not be investigated as \"no criminal offences were disclosed\".",
          "Some reported having traveled multiple hours and want their train fares covered.",
          "Don’t worry.",
          "Glasgow, Scotland.",
          "“Clearly, this crowd in Dublin was not a flash mob, but it did have many of the same attributes in terms of how it was created.”\nOnly this time, the mob showed up and nothing was there.",
          "However, smaller text interspersed throughout the lengthy post said \"Dublin Halloween Parade is cancelled!\"",
          "\"Willy Wonka event leaves bitter taste with artificially sweetened promises\".",
          "Well, I’m glad you didn’t do that.",
          "Not 1 single picture giving people an idea of what they are shelling out money for and yet people are buying up tickets.”\n“Indulge in a Chocolate fantasy like never before,” read the website.",
          "Supported by\nAll Trick, No Treat: Dublin Crowds Turn Up for Halloween Parade That Wasn’t\nThe scariest thing this Halloween?",
          "Per Connell, he was hired a few days before the event, then was handed an “AI-generated gibberish” script and told he could “do whatever you want.” Kirsty Paterson, an aspiring actor/fire dancer/yoga instructor who portrayed an Oompah Loompa that went viral, told Vulture she took the job because it offered £500 for two days of work.",
          "despite any ruffled feathers.",
          "I am actually good, but we are highly embarrassed.",
          "a place full of bad things!!!",
          "Were there any sweet treats?",
          "Update: March, 1st, 3:00 p.m ET: Things have gotten even wilder in the world of Willy's Chocolate Experience.",
          "“I looked at the website and I thought it was legit.",

          "The company's European CMO, Javier Meza, explained the decision in an interview with Marketing Week, saying Coca-Cola wanted to bring this year's holiday commercial to \"today's times.\"",
          "The ads depict squirrels and rabbits peeking out to watch the passing caravans and a man being handed an ice-cold bottle of cola by Santa Claus.",
          "With temperatures dropping, nights growing longer and decorations starting to appear in store windows, the holidays are on their way.",
          "The reaction online has been overwhelmingly negative, with comments on the YouTube video and across social media calling it \"slop,\" \"embarrassing,\" and \"creepy.\"",

          "In a statement, a Coca-Cola spokesperson said, \"The Coca-Cola Company has celebrated a long history of capturing the magic of the holidays in content, film, events and retail activations for decades around the globe.",
          "The company’s nostalgia-filled commercials are a holiday tradition, but this year’s ads are facing backlash for dipping into the uncanny valley.",
          "In fact, the reception is so harsh that it's actually pretty difficult to find any positive sentiment.",

          "“Coca Cola has been the gold standard in branding and advertising for decades.”\nAlex Hirsch, an animator and the creator of the Disney series “Gravity Falls,” expressed a sentiment that other creative professionals have shared online, noting that the brand’s signature red represented the “blood of out-of-work artists.”\nThe company, however, is sticking by the ads.",

          "“But then you throw AI into the mix that is not a fit, that is not a fit with holiday timing, but also, to some degree, also Coke, what the brand means to people.”\nToys R Us faced similar backlash online over the summer for an AI-made commercial that depicted the company’s late founder in a bike shop alongside the brand mascot.",

          "Coca-Cola is facing backlash online over an artificial intelligence-made Christmas promotional video that users are calling “soulless” and “devoid of any actual creativity.”\nThe AI-made video features everything from big red Coca-Cola trucks driving through snowy streets to people smiling in scarves and knitted hats holding Coca-Cola bottles.",
          "[20] In response to the negative feedback, the company defended their decision to use generative artificial intelligence stating that \"Coca-Cola will always remain dedicated to creating the highest level of work at the intersection of human creativity and technology\".",
          "When it comes to famous Christmas commercials, there aren't too many that are more iconic and nostalgic than Coca-Cola's 1995 \"Holidays Are Coming\" spot.",
          "Pratik Thakar, a vice president of Coca-Cola and the company’s global head of generative A.I., discussed the project in a recent interview with Ad Age, which previewed a screening of one of the spots at its Emerging Tech Summit last week.",
          "“Coca-Cola just put out an ad and ruined Christmas,” Dylan Pearce, one of the campaign’s many critics, said on TikTok, adding, “To put out slop like this just ruins the Christmas spirit.”\n“This is legit heartbreaking,” another user, De’Vion Hinton, posted on X.",
          "This isn’t the first time that Coca-Cola has used AI technology in its marketing strategies and programs.",
          "Neeraj Arora, the chair of marketing research and education at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, said the reason why the company faced backlash for this specific advertisement, and not for “Masterpiece” last year, could be because many consumers recognize Christmas as an integral part of the company’s brand, and AI technology acts as a disruption.",
