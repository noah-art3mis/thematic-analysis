Terms proposed included \\\"AI garbage\\\", \\\"AI pollution\\\", and \\\"AI-generated dross\\\".[5] Early uses of the term \\\"slop\\\" as a descriptor for low-grade AI material apparently came in reaction to the release of AI image generators in 2022. Its early use has been noted among 4chan, Hacker News, and YouTube commentators as a form of in-group slang.[7]\\nThe British computer programmer Simon Willison is credited with being an early champion of the term \\\"slop\\\" in the mainstream,[1][7] having used it on his personal blog in May 2024.[9] However, he has said it was in use long before he began pushing for the term.[7]\\nThe term gained increased popularity in the second quarter of 2024 in part because of Google's use of its Gemini AI model to generate responses to search queries,[7] and was widely criticized in media headlines during the fourth quarter of 2024.[1][4]\\nOn social media\\n[edit]AI image and video slop proliferated on social media in part because it was revenue-generating for its creators on Facebook and TikTok, with the issue affecting Facebook most notably. This incentivizes individuals from developing countries to create images that appeal to audiences in the United States which attract higher advertising rates.[10][11][12]\\nThe journalist Jason Koebler speculated that the bizarre nature of some of the content may be due to the creators using Hindi, Urdu, and Vietnamese prompts (languages which are underrepresented in the model's training data), or using erratic speech-to-text methods to translate their intentions into English.[10]\\nSpeaking to New York magazine, a Kenyan creator of slop images described giving ChatGPT prompts such as \\\"WRITE ME 10 PROMPT picture OF JESUS WHICH WILLING BRING HIGH ENGAGEMENT ON FACEBOOK [sic]\\\", and then feeding those created prompts into a text-to-image AI service such as Midjourney.[4]\\nIn politics\\n[edit]The examples and perspective in this section deal primarily with the United States and do not represent a worldwide view of the subject. (April 2025) |\\nIn August 2024, The Atlantic noted that AI slop was becoming associated with the political right in the United States, who were using it for shitposting and engagement farming on social media, with the technology offering \\\"cheap, fast, on-demand fodder for content\\\".[13]\\nAI slop is frequently used in political campaigns in an attempt at gaining attention through content farming.[14] In August 2024, the American politician Donald Trump posted a series of AI-generated images on his social media platform, Truth Social, that portrayed fans of the singer Taylor Swift in \\\"Swifties for Trump\\\" T-shirts, as well as a photo of the singer herself appearing to endorse Trump's 2024 presidential campaign. The images originated from the conservative Twitter account @amuse, which posted numerous AI slop images leading up to the 2024 United States elections that were shared by other high-profile figures within the American Republican Party, such as Elon Musk, who has publicly endorsed the utilization of generative AI, furthering this association.[15]\\nIn the aftermath of Hurricane Helene in the United States, members of the Republican Party circulated an AI-generated image of a young girl holding a puppy in a flood, and used it as evidence of the failure of President Joe Biden to respond to the disaster.[16][3] Some, like Amy Kremer, shared the image on social media even while acknowledging that it was not genuine.[17][18]\\nIn advertising\\n[edit]In November 2024, Coca-Cola used artificial intelligence to create three commercials as part of their annual holiday campaign. These videos were immediately met with negative reception from both casual viewers and artists;[19] the animator Alex Hirsch, the creator of Gravity Falls, criticized the company's decision not to employ human artists to create the commercial.[20] In response to the negative feedback, the company defended their decision to use generative artificial intelligence stating that \\\"Coca-Cola will always remain dedicated to creating the highest level of work at the intersection of human creativity and technology\\\".[21]\\nIn March 2025, Paramount Pictures was criticized for using AI scripting and narration in an Instagram video promoting the film Novocaine.[22] The ad uses a robotic AI voice in a style similar to low-quality AI spam videos produced by content farms. A24 received similar backlash for releasing a series of AI-generated posters for the 2024 film Civil War. One poster appears to depict a group of soldiers in a tank-like raft preparing to fire on a large swan, an image which does not resemble the events of the film.[23][24]\\nIn the same month, Activision posted various advertisements and posters for fake video games such as \\\"Guitar Hero Mobile\\\", \\\"Crash Bandicoot: Brawl\\\", and \\\"Call of Duty: Zombie Defender\\\" that were all made using generative AI on platforms such as Facebook and Instagram, which many labelled as AI slop.[25] The intention of the posts was later stated to act as a survey for interest in possible titles by the company.[26] The Italian brainrot AI trend was widely adopted by advertisers to adjust well to younger audiences.[27]\\nIn event listings\\n[edit]Fantastical promotional graphics for the 2024 Willy's Chocolate Experience event, characterized as \\\"AI-generated slop\\\",[28] misled audiences into attending an event that was held in a lightly decorated warehouse. Tickets were marketed through Facebook advertisements showing AI-generated imagery, with no genuine photographs of the venue.[29]\\nIn October 2024, thousands of people were reported to have assembled for a non-existent Halloween parade in Dublin as a result of a listing on an aggregation listings website, MySpiritHalloween.com, which used AI-generated content.[30][31] The listing went viral on TikTok and Instagram.[32] While a similar parade had been held in Galway, and Dublin had hosted parades in prior years, there was no parade in Dublin in 2024.[31] One analyst characterized the website, which appeared to use AI-generated staff pictures, as likely using artificial intelligence \\\"to create content quickly and cheaply where opportunities are found\\\".[33] The site's owner said that \\\"We asked ChatGPT to write the article for us, but it wasn't ChatGPT by itself.\\\" In the past the site had removed non-existent events when contacted by their venues, but in the case of the Dublin parade the site owner said that \\\"no one reported that this one wasn't going to happen\\\". MySpiritHalloween.com updated their page to say that the parade had been \\\"canceled\\\" when they became aware of the issue.[34]\\nIn books\\n[edit]Online booksellers and library vendors now have many titles that are written by AI and are not curated into collections by librarians. The digital media provider Hoopla, which supplies libraries with ebooks and downloadable content, has generative AI books with fictional authors and dubious quality, which cost libraries money when checked out by unsuspecting patrons.[35]\\nIn video games\\n[edit]The 2024 video game Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 includes assets generated by artificial intelligence. Since the game's initial release, many players had accused Treyarch and Raven Software of using AI to create in-game assets, including loading screens, emblems, and calling cards. A particular example was a loading screen for the zombies game mode that depicted \\\"Necroclaus\\\", a zombified Santa Claus with six fingers on one hand, an image which also had other irregularities.[36] The previous entry in the Call of Duty franchise was also accused of selling AI-generated cosmetics.[37]\\nIn February 2025, Activision disclosed Black Ops 6's usage of generative artificial intelligence to comply with Valve's policies on AI-generated or assisted products on Steam. Activision states on the game's product page on Steam that \\\"Our team uses generative AI tools to help develop some in game assets.\\\"[38]\\nFoamstars, a multiplayer third-person shooter released by Square Enix in 2024, features in-game music with cover art that was generated using Midjourney. Square Enix confirmed the use of AI, but defended the decision, saying that they wanted to \\\"experiment\\\" with artificial intelligence technologies and claiming that the generated assets make up \\\"about 0.01% or even less\\\" of game content.[39][40][41] Previously, on January 1, 2024, Square Enix president Takashi Kiryu stated in a new year letter that the company will be \\\"aggressive in applying AI and other cutting-edge technologies to both [their] content development and [their] publishing functions\\\".[42][43]\\nIn 2024, Rovio Entertainment released a demo of a mobile game called Angry Birds: Block Quest on Android. The game featured AI-generated images for loading screens and backgrounds.[44] It was heavily criticized by players, who called it shovelware and disapproved of Rovio's use of AI images.[45][46] It was eventually discontinued and removed from the Play Store.\\nIn film and television\\n[edit]Some films have received backlash for including AI-generated content. The film Late Night with the Devil was notable for its use of AI, which some criticized as being AI slop.[47][48] Several low-quality AI-generated images were used as interstitial title cards, with one image featuring a skeleton with inaccurate bone structure and poorly-generated fingers that appear disconnected from its hands.[49]\\nSome streaming services such as Amazon Prime Video have used AI to generate posters and thumbnail images in a manner that can be described as slop. A low-quality AI poster was used for the 1922 film Nosferatu, depicting Count Orlok in a way that does not resemble his look in the film.[50] A thumbnail image for 12 Angry Men on Amazon Freevee used AI to depict 19 men with smudged faces, none of whom appeared to bear any similarities to the characters in the film.[51][52] Additionally, some viewers have noticed that many plot descriptions appear to be generated by AI, which some people have characterized as slop. One synopsis briefly listed on the site for the film Dog Day Afternoon read: \\\"A man takes hostages at a bank in Brooklyn. Unfortunately I do not have enough information to summarize further within the provided guidelines.\\\"[53]\\nIn one case Deutsche Telekom removed a series from their media offer after viewers complained about the bad quality and monotonous German voice dubbing (translated from original Polish) and it was found out that it was done via AI.[54]\\nSee also\\n[edit]- AI boom \\u2013 Ongoing period of rapid progress in AI\\n- Content farm \\u2013 Organizations that mass produce content\\n- Dead Internet theory \\u2013 Conspiracy theory on online bot activity\\n- Elsagate \\u2013 Controversy concerning a genre of YouTube videos\\n- Enshittification \\u2013 Systematic decline in online platform quality\\n- Hallucination (artificial intelligence) \\u2013 Erroneous material generated by AI\\n- Italian brainrot \\u2013 Series of 2025 Internet memes\\n- Low culture \\u2013 Term for forms of popular culture with mass appeal\\nReferences\\n[edit]- ^ a b c d Hern, Alex; Milmo, Dan (19 May 2024). \\\"Spam, junk ... slop?

Your letterbox is full of junk mail. Now, your web browser has its own affliction: slop.\\n\\u201cSlop\\u201d is what you get when you shove artificial intelligence-generated material up on the web for anyone to view.\\nUnlike a chatbot, the slop isn\\u2019t interactive, and is rarely intended to actually answer readers\\u2019 questions or serve their needs.\\nInstead, it functions mostly to create the appearance of human-made content, benefit from advertising revenue and steer search engine attention towards other sites.\\nJust like spam, almost no one wants to view slop, but the economics of the internet lead to its creation anyway. AI models make it trivial to automatically generate vast quantities of text or images, providing an answer to any imaginable search query, uploading endless shareable landscapes and inspirational stories, and creating an army of supportive comments. If just a handful of users land on the site, reshare the meme or click through the adverts hosted, the cost of its creation pays off.\\nBut like spam, its overall effect is negative: the lost time and effort of users who now have to wade through slop to find the content they\\u2019re actually seeking far outweighs the profit to the slop creator.\\n\\u201cI think having a name for this is really important, because it gives people a concise way to talk about the problem,\\u201d says the developer Simon Willison, one of the early proponents of the term \\u201cslop\\u201d.\\n\\u201cBefore the term \\u2018spam\\u2019 entered general use it wasn\\u2019t necessarily clear to everyone that unwanted marketing messages were a bad way to behave. I\\u2019m hoping \\u2018slop\\u2019 has the same impact \\u2013 it can make it clear to people that generating and publishing unreviewed AI-generated content is bad behaviour.\\u201d\\nSlop is most obviously harmful when it is just plain wrong. Willison pointed to an AI-generated Microsoft Travel article that listed the \\u201cOttawa food bank\\u201d as a must-see attraction in the Canadian capital as a perfect example of the problem. Occasionally, a piece of slop is so useless that it goes viral in its own right, like the careers advice article that earnestly explains the punchline to a decades-old newspaper comic: \\u201cthey pay me in woims\\u201d.\\n\\u201cWhile the precise meaning of \\u2018They Pay Me in Woims\\u2019 remains ambiguous, various interpretations have emerged, ranging from a playful comment on work-life balance to a deeper exploration of our perceived reality,\\u201d the slop begins.\\nAI-generated books have become a problem too. A prominent example came when amateur mushroom pickers were recently warned to avoid foraging books sold on Amazon that appeared to have been written by chatbots and contained dangerous advice for anyone hoping to discern a lethal fungus from an edible one.\\nImage-generated slop has also blossomed on Facebook, as images of Jesus Christ with prawns for limbs, children in plastic bottle-cars, fake dream homes and improbably old women claiming to have baked their 122nd birthday cake garner thousands of shares.\\nJason Koebler of the tech news site 404 Media believes the trend represents what he calls the \\u201czombie internet\\u201d. The rise of slop, he says, has turned the social network into a space where \\u201ca mix of bots, humans and accounts that were once humans but aren\\u2019t any more mix together to form a disastrous website where there is little social connection at all.\\u201d\\nNick Clegg, the president of global affairs at Facebook\\u2019s parent company, Meta, wrote in February that the social network is training its systems to identify AI-made content. \\u201cAs the difference between human and synthetic content gets blurred, people want to know where the boundary lies,\\u201d he wrote.\\nThe problem has begun to worry the social media industry\\u2019s main revenue source: the advertising agencies who pay to place ads next to content. Farhad Divecha, the managing director of UK-based digital marketing agency AccuraCast, says he is now encountering cases where users are mistakenly flagging ads as AI-made slop when they are not.\\n\\u201cWe have seen instances where people have commented that an advert was AI-generated rubbish when it was not,\\u201d he says, adding that it could become a problem for the social media industry if consumers \\u201cstart to feel they are being served rubbish all the time\\u201d.\\nTackling spam in inboxes required an enormous cross-industry effort and led to a fundamental change in the nature of email. Big webmail providers like Gmail aggressively monitor their own platforms to crack down on spammers and are increasingly suspicious of emails arriving from untrusted email servers. They also apply complex, largely undocumented, AI systems to try to detect spam directly, in a constant cat-and-mouse game with the spammers themselves.\\nFor slop, the future is less rosy: the world\\u2019s largest companies have gone from gamekeeper to poacher. Last week, Google announced an ambitious plan to add AI-made answers to the top of some search results, with US-based users the first to experience a full rollout of the \\u201cAI Overviews\\u201d feature. It will include links as well, but users who want to limit the response to just a selection of links to other websites will be able to find them \\u2013 by clicking through to \\u201cweb\\u201d on the search engine, demoted to sit beside \\u201cimages\\u201d and \\u201cmaps\\u201d on the list of options.\\n\\u201cWe\\u2019ve added this after hearing from some that there are times when they\\u2019d prefer to just see links to webpages in their search results,\\u201d wrote Danny Sullivan, the company\\u2019s search liaison.\\nGoogle says the AI overviews have strong safety guardrails. Elsewhere on the web though, slop is spreading.\", \"source\": \"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/article/2024/may/19/spam-junk-slop-the-latest-wave-of-ai-behind-the-zombie-internet\", \"word_count\": 916, \"sentiments\": [0.06223544973544975, 0.48013756613756603], \"polarity\": 0.06223544973544975, \"subjectivity\": 0.48013756613756603}, {\"_id\": 3, \"title\": \"Why doesn't Facebook just ban AI slop like Shrimp Jesus?\", \"excerpt\": \"Engagement-bait AI images like Shrimp Jesus are all over Facebook.

A woman bicycling with a basket full of babies and burritos.\\nThis is all \\\"AI slop,\\\" a new term describing the sudden flood of garbage AI-generated content, from e-books to viral photos. Slop is everywhere on the internet, but its purest version exists on Facebook.\\nThis is the Shrimp Jesus kind of slop: bizarre, obviously fake, and sometimes vaguely unsettling in a trypophobia-triggering way. Common themes involve old people holding a birthday cake asking you to wish them a happy birthday; babies doing things babies shouldn't do; snakes eating buses, bikes, or other vehicles overloaded with hundreds of babies or some other cargo; soldiers with prosthetic legs; women with missing limbs and huge busts; and Jesus. The images are often sort of eerily exploitative.\\nThese tend to be posted on Facebook pages with generic-sounding names and captions that don't necessarily reflect the photo, like \\\"why don't photos like this ever trend,\\\" or \\\"beautiful cabin crew,\\\" or \\\"Scarlett Johansson\\\" for an image of Jesus built into the hood of a car.\\nWhy slop? The best explanation is that the Facebook pages posting these are making bait for scam targets, helping scammers identify gullible people in the comments who they can extract money from.\\nAnother possibility is that posting these images is a good tactic to build up a large page audience, which can be lucrative.\\nThe vague similarities among the pages suggest the AI slop is being posted by a network of shady actors based in countries outside the US. It's spam-adjacent stuff \\u2014 if not outright spam.\\nThis slop is sloppy enough that it can sometimes be very funny \\u2014 and there's even an X account, Insane Facebook AI Slop, dedicated to cataloging it.\\nIt's embarrassing to Facebook that people on X \\u2014 X!!! a place full of bad things!!! \\u2014 are laughing at Meta's poor content moderation.\\nThis has been going on for quite a few months now. 404 Media, which has been diligently covering this, has described how these images are part of an AI-fueled \\\"zombie internet\\\" full of bots talking to bots. Not too long ago, I speculated about why Meta hadn't cracked down, but considering nothing has seemed to change, I find myself wondering yet again \\u2026\\nWhy doesn't Facebook just ban this slop?\\nHere are a few of my theories:\\n- These images don't technically violate any rules \\u2014 no nudity or other forbidden imagery.\\n- Facebook did make a warning label to note that an image may have been made with AI.\\n- Users actually enjoy this content \\u2014 you see plenty of people in the comments who are probably duped and think it's a real image, or maybe just an interesting artistic rendition. Why mess with content people like?\\n- Facebook does ban this stuff, but only at an account level when the account posting it engages in obvious spam tactics. But not all the accounts are spamming.\\n- Slop is often scam-adjacent, but the accounts posting it may not directly be the ones doing the scams, so they don't get banned.\\n- Facebook worries that banning this kind of AI content will set a bad precedent because it wants to encourage people to make stuff with its own Llama 3 tools.\\n- Facebook doesn't like the AI slop but has bigger things to worry about.\\n- Facebook has stopped trying. This is what Jason Koebler from 404 Media speculates. Meta's previous commitments to working with researchers and academics have fizzled away, and the scrutiny over content moderation (helped by Elon Musk lowering the bar to the basement) has shifted. Meta is penny-pinching and focusing on the newest shiny thing (AI tools, Instagram, the metaverse) and cares less and less about Facebook, this theory goes. Basically, they don't give a shit anymore.\\nI imagine some combination of all these things may be true to some degree. A representative for Meta didn't reply to questions about why they don't simply ban AI slop. (I had also recently asked a vice president of product at Meta about why they don't just ban this slop, and he sort of changed the subject; it seemed like maybe he wasn't sure what I was talking about.)\\nFacebook has gone through so many different flavors of spammy/scammy engagement bait, from Minions memes to videos from magicians to actually dangerous fake news and extremist groups.

Something strange was happening at Clarkesworld, the magazine Clarke had founded in 2006 and built into a pillar of the world of speculative fiction. Submissions were increasing rapidly, but \\u201cthere was something off about them,\\u201d he told me recently. He summarized a typical example: \\u201cUsually, it begins with the phrase \\u2018In the year 2250-something\\u2019 and then it goes on to say the Earth\\u2019s environment is in collapse and there are only three scientists who can save us. Then it describes them in great detail, each one with its own paragraph. And then \\u2014 they\\u2019ve solved it! You know, it skips a major plot element, and the final scene is a celebration out of the ending of Star Wars.\\u201d Clarke said he had received \\u201cdozens of this story in various incarnations.\\u201d\\nThese are prime examples of what is now known as slop: a term of art, akin to spam, for low-rent, scammy garbage generated by artificial intelligence and increasingly prevalent across the internet \\u2014 and beyond. From their weird narrative instincts and inert prose, Clarke realized the stories came straight from ChatGPT. Sometimes they would arrive with the original prompt included, which was often as simple as \\u201cWrite a 1,000-word science-fiction story.\\u201d\\nIt was relatively easy to identify an AI-generated submission, but that required reading thousands (a \\u201cwall of noise\\u201d) and manually sorting them. Clarke compared the problem to turning off the spam filter and trying to read your email: \\u201cOkay, now multiply that by ten because that\\u2019s the ratio that we were getting.\\u201d Within weeks, the problem became unmanageable. \\u201cWe had reached the point where we were on track to receive as many generated submissions as legitimate ones,\\u201d Clarke told me. Eventually, on February 20, he made the decision to close submissions temporarily. Clarkesworld had become one of the first victims of AI slop.\\nIn the nearly two years since, a rising tide of slop has begun to swamp most of what we think of as the internet, overrunning the biggest platforms with cheap fakes and drivel, seeming to crowd out human creativity and intentionality with weird AI crap. On Facebook, enigmatic pages post disturbing images of maimed children and alien Jesuses; on Twitter, bots cluster by the thousands, chipperly and supportively tweeting incoherent banalities at one another; on Spotify, networks of eerily similar and wholly imaginary country and electronic artists glut playlists with bizarre and lifeless songs; on Kindle, shoddy books with stilted, error-ridden titles (The Spellbound Quest: Students Perilous Journey to Correct Their Mistake) are advertised on idle lock screens with blandly uncanny illustrations.\\nIf it were all just a slightly more efficient form of spam, distracting and deceiving Facebook-addled grandparents, that would be one thing. But the slop tide threatens some of the key functions of the web, clogging search results with nonsense, overwhelming small institutions like Clarkesworld, and generally polluting the already fragile information ecosystem of the internet. Last week, Robyn Speer, the creator of WordFreq, a database that tracks word frequency online, announced that she would no longer be updating it owing to the torrent of slop. \\u201cI don\\u2019t think anyone has reliable information about post-2021 language usage by humans,\\u201d Speer wrote. There is a fear that as slop takes over, the large language models, or LLMs, that train on internet text will \\u201ccollapse\\u201d into ineffectiveness \\u2014 garbage in, garbage out. But even this horror story is a kind of wishful thinking: Recent research suggests that as long as an LLM\\u2019s training corpus contains at least 10 percent non-synthetic \\u2014 that is, human \\u2014 output, it can continue producing slop forever.\\nWorse than the havoc it wreaks on the internet, slop easily escapes the confines of the computer and enters off-screen systems in exasperating, troubling, and dangerous ways. In June, researchers published a study that concluded that one-tenth of the academic papers they examined \\u201cwere processed with LLMs,\\u201d calling into question not just those individual papers but whole networks of citation and reference on which scientific knowledge relies. Derek Sullivan, a cataloguer at a public-library system in Pennsylvania, told me that AI-generated books had begun to cross his desk regularly. Though he first noticed the problem thanks to a recipe book by a nonexistent author that featured \\u201ca meal plan that told you to eat straight marinara sauce for lunch,\\u201d the slop books he sees often cover highly consequential subjects like living with fibromyalgia or raising children with ADHD. In the worst version of the slop future, your overwhelmed and underfunded local library is half-filled with these unchecked, unreviewed, unedited AI-generated artifacts, dispensing hallucinated facts and inhuman advice and distinguishable from their human-authored competition only through ceaseless effort.\\nClarkesworld was, luckily, only temporarily disabled by the slop deluge; over the course of March 2023, with the help of volunteers, Clarke built a \\u201cvery rudimentary spam filter,\\u201d and by the end of the month the magazine was able to reopen submissions. Clarke doesn\\u2019t like to describe how the filter works for fear of giving too much away to the spammers, but \\u201cit\\u2019s holding things at bay,\\u201d he said. Still, \\u201cit\\u2019s clear that business as usual won\\u2019t be sustainable,\\u201d he wrote in a blog post describing the problem. \\u201cIf the field can\\u2019t find a way to address this situation, things will begin to break.\\u201d\\nThe information superhighway\\u201d: That\\u2019s what the internet was supposed to be. And while it\\u2019s hard to regard the internet we have now as a wholly beneficent advance in collective wisdom \\u2014 the commercial opportunities afforded by connecting billions of people sit uncomfortably with the civic aspirations of some of the web\\u2019s pioneers \\u2014 it\\u2019s hard to deny that an information superhighway, with some tolls and billboards and potholes, is more or less what we\\u2019ve got. It\\u2019s still the first place most of us go to answer questions, to find out what\\u2019s happening, and to learn new things.\\nSince the arrival of widespread consumer-grade generative AI, these tasks have become progressively more difficult. Answering questions via Google now requires contending with AI-authored \\u201cOverview\\u201d modules at the top of some search pages, which offer incorrect summaries \\u2014 \\u201cNone of Africa\\u2019s 54 recognized countries start with the letter \\u2018K,\\u2019\\u201d one Overview claimed \\u2014 just often enough to render them untrustworthy. Attempting to read news online is now fraught with the possibility that you\\u2019re consuming unedited AI-generated tattle: CNET, BuzzFeed, USA Today, and Sports Illustrated have published stilted and often incorrect AI-generated articles or used phony images and biographies for \\u201cauthors.\\u201d\\nImagine you are going foraging and want to download to your Kindle a guide to distinguish between edible and toxic mushrooms. If you look on Amazon, you\\u2019ll turn up some obviously legitimate books. But early on in the search results, you\\u2019ll find some seemingly AI-generated guides as well \\u2014 for example, Forager\\u2019s Harvest 101: A Comprehensive Guide to Identifying, Preserving, and Preparing Wild Edible Plants, Mushrooms, Berries, and Fruits, by \\u201cDiane Wells.\\u201d Elan Trybuch, the secretary of the New York Mycological Society, recently wrote a blog post warning mushroom foragers about these dangerously inadequate guides: It\\u2019s possible that Forager\\u2019s Harvest 101 is fully accurate and safe to use, but it\\u2019s almost certainly unreviewed and unchecked and \\u201cwritten\\u201d by an AI that, as Trybuch described the technology, \\u201cdoes not know the subtle differences between a mushroom that is poisonous \\u2026 vs one that is not.\\u201d\\nIt\\u2019s not particularly easy to tell the difference between the AI-generated guides and those written by experts. Forager\\u2019s Harvest 101 has an intelligibly (if cheaply) designed cover and legible (if smooth and voiceless) prose as well as an author biography featuring a photo of a smiling middle-aged woman. Is this a completely AI-generated object, a self-published pamphlet, or a book from a publishing house that recently slashed its marketing and editing budgets? Indeed, I feel comfortable saying it\\u2019s AI-generated only because a watermark on Diane\\u2019s author photo credits it to the AI that powers the fake-portrait website ThisPersonDoesNotExist.com.\\nExperiences like this \\u2014 staring at a collection of books written by AI with computer-generated author photos and dozens of reviews written and posted by bots \\u2014 have become for many people evidence for the \\u201cdead-internet theory,\\u201d the only slightly tongue-in-cheek idea, inspired by the increasing amount of fake, suspicious, and just plain weird content, that humans are a tiny minority online and the bulk of the internet is made by and for AI bots, creating bot content for bot followers, who comment and argue with other bots. The rise of slop has, appropriately, the shape of a good science-fiction yarn: a mysterious wave of noise emerging from nowhere, an alien invasion of semi-coherent computers babbling in humanlike voices from some vast electronic beyond.\\nBut the idea that AI has quietly crowded out humans is not exactly right. Slop requires human intervention or it wouldn\\u2019t exist. Beneath the strange and alienating flood of machine-generated content slop, behind the nonhuman fable of dead-internet theory, is something resolutely, distinctly human: a thriving, global gray-market economy of spammers and entrepreneurs, searching out and selling get-rich-quick schemes and arbitrage opportunities, supercharged by generative AI.\\nWe know that the original source of these things was side-hustle scams,\\u201d Clarke told me. \\u201cPeople waving a bunch of money on YouTube or TikTok videos and saying, \\u2018Oh, you can make money with ChatGPT by doing this.\\u2019\\u201d Clarke could even trace spikes in submissions to specific videos: It\\u2019s not some burgeoning artificial super-intelligence or even a particularly sophisticated crew of scammers that has waylaid Clarkesworld; rather, it\\u2019s the audiences of influencers like Hanna Getachew, an accountant and technology-procurement manager who runs an Amharic-language YouTube account dedicated to \\u201cteaching side hustles and online jobs\\u201d \\u2014 and who recently posted a video called \\u201cGet Paid With Clarkes World Magazine.\\u201d (Clarkesworld pays 12 cents per word for submissions of 1,000 to 22,000 words. Getachew claims viewers can \\u201cearn between $250 and $2,460.\\u201d)\\nThe economics involved are simple. On one end, the demand: the effectively infinite, indiscriminate appetite for content of websites like Facebook and TikTok, which need enticements for users and real estate for advertisers. On the other, the supply: the astonishingly adequate, inexhaustible output of generative-AI apps like ChatGPT, Midjourney, or Microsoft\\u2019s Image Creator, heavily subsidized by investors and provided to consumers at low or no cost.\\nBillions of dollars are flowing among the many companies on either side of this dynamic, and the question for any would-be AI hustler is how to get in the middle, find an angle, and take a cut. The simplest, most straightforward option is to be a \\u201cslopper\\u201d: someone who generates content at scale using AI and manipulates or leverages a platform to make money from it. Sloppers may try to sell their content directly to people on a major marketplace \\u2014 by, say, automating the production of recipe books to sell to unsuspecting (and maybe undiscriminating) customers on Amazon. Or they may build a website filled with articles generated by an LLM, festoon them with advertisements, and try to get them highly ranked on Google News. Maybe, and most straightforwardly of all, many simply vie for direct payments from platforms for AI-generated text, images, and videos: Facebook, TikTok, and Twitter all offer bonus payments for \\u201cengaging\\u201d content. (In a sense, so does Spotify, though we call those payments \\u201croyalties.\\u201d)\\nTake, as a case study in the slop economy, Facebook. Since the beginning of this year, obviously AI-generated images from anonymously administered pages have become inescapable. What began as riffs on already viral images have evolved into bizarre, sui generis dreamscapes through which inexplicable and unrelated themes and topics emerge: multiheaded, enormously breasted \\u201cfarmer girls\\u201d; stewardesses wading in muddy rivers; amputee beggars carrying signs reading TODAY IS MY BIRTHDAY. One of the most famous of these images is \\u201cShrimp Jesus,\\u201d a statuelike Jesus figure bobbing just underwater, his limbs and torso made entirely of the bristling chitinous bodies of shrimp. For the majority of these pages, there is no obvious scam at play, no ads or external links \\u2014 no business model at all, just eerily contextless pages publishing demented nonsense into a void.\\nWhere were these images coming from? The answer, at least in part, is a guy in Kenya named Stephen Mwangi. (At least, I think that\\u2019s his name and where he lives.) Stevo, as he introduced himself to me over WhatsApp, is the moderator of five YouTube channels and \\u201cabout 170 Facebook pages\\u201d that deal heavily in AI-generated images, the largest of which has 4 million followers. He agreed to show me his methods, for a price. \\u201cIf you need my information pay me,\\u201d he wrote. \\u201cNo free information.\\u201d For a total of $105, I enrolled in a crash course in becoming a slopper.\\nHis process for creating posts, he told me, is pretty simple and AI intensive: \\u201cI use ChatGPT to ask for the best images that can generate a lot of popularity and engagement on Facebook,\\u201d focusing on topics like the Bible, God, the U.S. Army, wildlife, and Manchester United. \\u201cWRITE ME 10 PROMPT picture OF JESUS WHICH WILLING BRING HIGH ENGAGEMENT ON FACEBOOK,\\u201d read the ChatGPT prompt in one screenshot he shared with me. You then take the prompts to the image-generation programs Leonardo.ai and Midjourney. Voil\\u00e0: slop.\\nThese pages make money through Facebook\\u2019s Performance bonus program, which, per the social network\\u2019s description, \\u201cgives creators the opportunity to earn money\\u201d based on \\u201cthe amount of reach, reactions, shares and comments\\u201d on their posts. It is, in effect, a slop subsidy. The AI images produced on Stevo\\u2019s pages \\u2014 rococo pictures of Jesus; muscular police officers standing on the beach holding large Bibles; grotesquely armored gargantuan helicopters \\u2014 are neither scams nor enticements nor even, as far as Facebook is concerned, junk. They are precisely what the company wants: highly engaging content.\\nOn a website like Facebook, the more strikingly weird an image is, the more likely it is to attract attention and engagement; the more attention and engagement, the more Facebook\\u2019s sorting mechanisms will promote and recirculate the image. Another AI content creator, a French financial auditor named Charles who makes bizarre pictorial stories about cats for TikTok, told me he always makes his content \\u201ca bit WTF\\u201d as \\u201ca way to make the content more viral, or at least to maximize the chances of it becoming viral.\\u201d Or as Stevo put it, \\u201cYou add some exaggeration to make it engagementing.\\u201d\\nStevo, who insisted he doesn\\u2019t \\u201cuse bots\\u201d to juice his follower numbers or \\u201cpay for engagement,\\u201d shared a screenshot that showed a $500 \\u201cbonus earnings\\u201d payout for activity from mid-May to mid-June this year. (Minimum wage in Kenya ranges from about $120 to $270 a month.) It\\u2019s not really passive income, either. He said he spends about six hours a day administering his Facebook pages, but he works at the mercy of the website\\u2019s opaque moderation and decision-making processes. When I spoke with him, \\u201cGod Lovers\\u201d had been placed under some kind of restrictions and wasn\\u2019t earning him money. He wasn\\u2019t sure what the problem was, but it wasn\\u2019t that the images were fake. \\u201cI have other pages which have over 100,000 followers which use AI images,\\u201d he said. Facebook doesn\\u2019t reveal how it calculates the value of the bonuses, and only creators in certain countries \\u2014 the U.S., the U.K., and India among them \\u2014 are eligible for the bonus program, which helps explain why, several times during our interview, Stephen insisted he was actually a British cybersecurity student named Jacob.\\nThere\\u2019s a Stephen (and often a \\u201cJacob\\u201d) behind all of this slop: an actual person uploading, say, identical Viking \\u201cnovels\\u201d with seemingly AI-generated covers, all called Wrath of the Northmen: A Gripping Viking Tale of Revenge and Honor (that one has been published variously by authors named Sula Urbant, Sula Urbanz, and Sula Urbanr). The sloppers gather on message boards and chat apps and social media to swap tips and tricks. On Facebook, a 130,000-member group of Vietnamese sloppers called \\u201cTwitter Academy \\u2014 Make Money on X\\u201d discusses methods of prompting ChatGPT to write X threads: \\u201cYou are a Twitter influencer with a large following. You have a Funny tone of voice. You have a Creative writing style. Do not self-reference. Do not explain what you are doing.\\u201d\\nThere are also hundreds of thousands of videos across the internet giving detailed instructions similar to the ones Stephen gave me. Jason Koebler, co-founder of 404 Media, an independent tech-news collective that acts as the publication of record for the world of slop, watched dozens of Hindi-language slop seminars on YouTube, many of them offering example prompts: \\u201camerican soldier veteran holding cardboard sign that says \\u2018today\\u2019s my birthday, please like\\u2019 injured in battle veteran war american flag,\\u201d \\u201cA old American women is making forest lion out of cauliflower and her neighbors looking at it. keep it detailed.\\u201d\\nThe creators of these kinds of seminars, equipped with the \\u201csell shovels in a gold rush\\u201d playbook, often have a more reliable income than the sloppers themselves. They sell lesson plans and memberships to private Discord and Telegram chat rooms and act as middlemen who help set up U.S.-based accounts for international sloppers. If sloppers are the manufacturing sector of the slop economy, these gurus, vouchers, and toolmakers represent the service sector.\\nThis ecosystem is not new. Influencers have been hawking platform-dependent \\u201cinternet marketing\\u201d schemes for decades. What has changed is the level of work and investment involved. For a while now, it has been common for entrepreneurs to outsource the actual production of content: \\u201cI have two people in the Philippines who post for me,\\u201d one American Facebook-page operator told The New York Times Magazine in 2016. But when you\\u2019ve got an automated post-creating machine, who needs two people in the Philippines? For that matter, given the sophistication of the AI, why would the Filipinos need an American?\\nThere\\u2019s no definitive way to tell how much slop has already been produced in the few short years generative-AI apps have been widely available, but there are ways to get a glimpse. Guillaume Cabanac, a professor of computer science at Universit\\u00e9 Toulouse III\\u2013Paul Sabatier, has spent the past several years attempting to ferret out instances of fraud, plagiarism, and the use of computer-generated text in major scientific journals. One of his methods is to focus on what he calls \\u201csmoking guns\\u201d \\u2014 phrases that show unambiguously the use of an AI text generator like ChatGPT. One of these is \\u201cregenerate response,\\u201d which appears at the end of ChatGPT\\u2019s answers. \\u201cThe persons did all that copy-paste and didn\\u2019t even care to remove\\u201d the telltale phrase, Cabanac said. Others are \\u201cas an AI language model,\\u201d \\u201cas of my knowledge cutoff,\\u201d and \\u201cI cannot fulfill that request,\\u201d phrases that ChatGPT and other chatbots use frequently.\\nCabanac has found almost 100 cases of obviously AI-generated scientific papers, which he called \\u201conly the tiny tip of the iceberg.\\u201d A recent study by the librarian Andrew Gray used words that appear disproportionately often in text generated by ChatGPT \\u2014 among them commendable, intricate, and meticulously \\u2014 to estimate that 60,000 scholarly papers were at least partially generated by AI in 2023.\\nYou can do your own versions of these experiments at home. Searching \\u201cas of my knowledge cutoff\\u201d or \\u201cas an AI language model\\u201d in Google Books turns up hundreds of AI-generated \\u201cbooks\\u201d with titles like Hollywood\\u2019s 100 Leading Actors and Summary If the Woman in Me: A Guide to Britney Spears Memoir. On Amazon, a quick search found a listing for some (presumably real) underwear with the description \\u201cAs of My Knowledge Cutoff in Early 2023, Providing Specific Purchasing Options for \\u2018Women\\u2019s Stylish Sexy Casual Independence Day Printed Panties\\u2019 Would Be My Capabilities As I Cannot Browse or Access Live Data From the Internet, Including Current Inventory From or Private Sellers.\\u201d\\nTwitter \\u2014 Elon Musk\\u2019s X \\u2014 may be the most fruitful platform for this kind of search thanks to its sub-competent moderation services. In January, Chris Mohney, a writer and an editor, spotted a tweet that appeared to be an AI-generated description of an image with no image attached: \\u201cThe photo captures a couple exchanging vows at sunset. The emotions that it evokes are love, happiness, and the memory of a special day filled with promises.\\u201d Hundreds of verified accounts swarmed in the replies to praise the missing image: \\u201cThis picture exudes pure love and joy, a magical moment indeed!,\\u201d \\u201cThis photo truly encapsulates the beauty and magic of true love,\\u201d \\u201cSuch a beautiful moment captured in time, filled with love and joy.\\u201d\\nCabanac believes \\u201cLLMs can be a magnificent tool, a very effective tool\\u201d for scientists if properly acknowledged. Some researchers, especially those for whom English is not a first language, use ChatGPT and other AI programs to help with translation and editing. But many people \\u201care using the LLMs to produce more, which lowers the quality of the science that is published and made.\\u201d Even innocuous misuse has a cascading effect on the entire scientific enterprise, as retracted papers cast doubt on other papers that cite them. \\u201cThe error propagates, right?\\u201d he said. \\u201cIt\\u2019s like a virus.\\u201d\\nAI-generated papers, Cabanac argued, are often used to pad an academic\\u2019s r\\u00e9sum\\u00e9 with more publications and citations: \\u201cYou buy a paper on a topic of your choice, and you buy a set of 500 citations. Then you go to your faculty and you say, \\u2018Look, I\\u2019m a genius, and I deserve this position as a full professor.\\u2019\\u201d In other words, like Facebook slop, the content of the content isn\\u2019t really as important as its presence \\u2014 or, more accurately, its measurability.\\nThis is the most widespread use yet found for generative-AI apps: creating stuff that can take up space and be counted. When you look through the reams of slop across the internet, AI seems less like a terrifying apocalyptic machine-god, ready to drag us into a new era of tech, and more like the apotheosis of the smartphone age \\u2014 the perfect internet marketer\\u2019s tool, precision-built to serve the disposable, lowest-common-denominator demands of the infinite scroll.\\nIt\\u2019s nice to think that if you could simply turn off your phone and computer, you could avoid all these ugly creations. But slop has a way of leaking out. In the most recent season of True Detective, a heavy-metal poster in the background of one scene was obviously and cheaply AI-generated. (The showrunner insisted the poster was diegetically AI-generated.) On the subway, ads for the secondhand-furniture website Kaiyo feature images with oddly levitating pedestrians and signs written in the dream glyphs typical of image generators\\u2019 attempts at text.\\nOutsourcing designwork to generative-AI apps may be an effective cost-cutting and productivity measure for some businesses, but in practice it just off-loads work elsewhere. The cost of slop to libraries is serious, Sullivan said, \\u201cnot just the cost of the books\\u201d but the cost of labor: It takes cataloguers longer to do their jobs when they\\u2019re wading through \\u201can outpouring of valueless product.\\u201d Human artists, writers, journalists, musicians, and even TikTokers have more work to do too, competing not just with other humans but with the passable products of automated systems.\\nThere\\u2019s more work for us readers and watchers and content consumers as well. The future portended by the past two years is one in which we all become cataloguers, Neil Clarkes sorting through the noise for a little bit of signal. Even the stuff that passes through is a burden; unrefined, unedited slop is by definition more work to read, watch, interpret, and understand.\\nBut it\\u2019s also, it seems, what we want. The other important participants in the slop economy, besides the sloppers and the influencers and the platforms, are all of us. Everyone who idly scrolls through Facebook or TikTok or Twitter on their phone, who puts Spotify on autoplay, or who buys the cheapest recipe book on Amazon is creating the demand.\\nFifteen years ago, Wired magazine heralded the \\u201cgood-enough revolution\\u201d in low-cost technology: \\u201cCheap, fast, simple tools are suddenly everywhere \\u2026 We now favor flexibility over high fidelity, convenience over features, quick and dirty over slow and polished.\\u201d Generative AI as a technology exists in this lineage. That it can create adequate texts and images is an astonishing leap forward in machine learning, but the texts and images are still only adequate, \\u201cgood enough\\u201d and cheap enough for people to thumb past on their phones. Slop is the most appropriate word for what it produces because, as disgusting and unappetizing as it may seem, we still eat it. It\\u2019s what\\u2019s right there in the trough.\", \"source\": \"https://web.archive.org/web/20250608033415/https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/ai-generated-content-internet-online-slop-spam.html\", \"word_count\": 4114, \"sentiments\": [0.10824522464352974, 0.5148476296145786], \"polarity\": 0.10824522464352974, \"subjectivity\": 0.5148476296145786}, {\"_id\": 6, \"title\": \"Opinion | How Long Will A.I.\\u2019s \\u2018Slop\\u2019 Era Last?\", \"excerpt\": \"Consumer-facing A.I. has become a nuisance.

It wasn\\u2019t that long ago, in the spring of last year, that the new chatbots were trailed by various \\u201cgodfathers\\u201d of the technology, warning of existential risk; by researchers suggesting a 10 percent chance of human extinction at the hands of robots; by executives speculating about future investment rounds tabulated in the trillions.\\nNow the reckoning is happening on very different terms. In a note from Barclays, one analyst warned that today\\u2019s A.I. investments might be three times as large as expected returns, while another analyst, in several assessments published by Sequoia Capital, calculated that investments in A.I. were running short of projected profits by a margin of at least several hundred billion dollars annually. (He called this \\u201cA.I.\\u2019s $600 billion question\\u201d and warned of \\u201cinvestment incineration.\\u201d) In a similarly bearish Goldman Sachs report, the firm\\u2019s head of global equity research estimated that the cost of A.I. infrastructure build-out over the next several years would reach $1 trillion. \\u201cReplacing low-wage jobs with tremendously costly technology is basically the polar opposite of the prior technology transitions I\\u2019ve witnessed,\\u201d he noted. \\u201cThe crucial question is: What $1 trillion problem will A.I. solve?\\u201d\\nA decade ago, venture capital provided Americans the \\u201cmillennial lifestyle subsidy\\u201d: investors keeping the price of Uber and DoorDash and dozens of other services artificially low for years. Today the same millennial might read about that trillion-dollar A.I. expenditure, more than the United States spends annually on its military, and think: What exactly is that money going toward? What is A.I. even for?\\nOne increasingly intuitive answer is \\u201cgarbage.\\u201d The neuroscientist Erik Hoel has called it \\u201cA.I. pollution,\\u201d and the physicist Anthony Aguirre \\u201csomething like noise\\u201d and \\u201cA.I.-generated dross.\\u201d More recently, it has inspired a more memorable neologistic term of revulsion, \\u201cA.I. slop\\u201d: often uncanny, frequently misleading material, now flooding web browsers and social-media platforms like spam in old inboxes. Years deep into national hysteria over the threat of internet misinformation pushed on us by bad actors, we\\u2019ve sleepwalked into a new internet in which meaningless, nonfactual slop is casually mass-produced and force-fed to us by A.I.\\nWhen Thomas Crooks tried to assassinate Donald Trump, for instance, X\\u2019s A.I. sputtered out a whole string of cartoonishly false trending topics, including that it was Kamala Harris who had been shot.\\nWhere not long ago we used to find the very best results for Google searches, we can now find instead potentially plagiarized and often inaccurate paragraph summaries of answers to our queries \\u2014 including, reportedly, that only 17 American presidents were white, that Barack Obama is a Muslim and that Andrew Johnson, who became president in 1865 and died in 1875, earned 13 college degrees between 1947 and 2012. We can also read that geologists advise eating at least one rock a day, that Elmer\\u2019s glue should be added to pizza sauce for thickening and that it\\u2019s completely chill to run with scissors.\\nSometimes, of course, you can get reliable information too; maybe even most of the time. But you can also get bad advice about A.D.H.D., about chemotherapy, about Ozempic \\u2014 some potentially delicate subjects. And while the internet was never perfectly trustworthy, one epoch-defining breakthrough of Google was that it got us pretty close. Now the company\\u2019s chief executive acknowledges that hallucinations are \\u201cinherent\\u201d to the technology it has celebrated as a kind of successor for ranked-order search results, which are now often found far below not just the A.I. summary but a whole stack of \\u201csponsored\\u201d results as well.\\nBut not all A.I.s are large language models like ChatGPT, Gemini or Claude, each of which were trained on gobsmackingly large quantities of text to better simulate interaction with humans and bring them closer to approximations of humanlike thinking, at least in theory. Peer away from those chatbots and you can see a very different story, with different robot protagonists: machine-learning tools trained much more narrowly and focused less on producing a conversational, natural-language interface than on processing data dumps much more efficiently than human minds ever could. These products are less eerie, which means they have generated little existential angst. They are also \\u2014 for now, at least \\u2014 much more reliable and productive.\\nThis month, KoBold Metals announced the largest discovery of new copper deposits in a decade \\u2014 a green-energy gold mine, so to speak, delivered with the help of its own proprietary A.I., which integrated information about subatomic particles detected underground with century-old mining reports and radar imagery to make predictions about where minerals critical for the green transition might be found. Machine learning may help make our electricity grid as much as 40 percent more efficient at delivering power as it is today, when many of its routing decisions are made by individual humans on the basis of experience and intuition. (At some crucial points, A.I. has cut decision time to one minute from 10.) It has already helped drive down the cost and drive up the performance of next-gen batteries and solar photovoltaic cells, whose performance can also be improved, even after the panels have been manufactured and installed on your roof, by as much as 25 percent. Our models of ice-sheet melt and rainforest degradation are much sharper now, too.\\nWhen in 2021 DeepMind revealed that it had effectively solved the protein-folding problem, making the three-dimensional structure of biological building blocks for the first time easily predictable for researchers, the breakthrough made global news, even if the headlines flew over the heads of most readers, who might not have known how significant a roadblock that has been in biomedical research. A few years later, A.I. is designing new proteins, rapidly accelerating drug discovery and speeding up clinical trials testing new medicines and therapies.\\nA year ago, as normies were only just toying around with chatbots, there were already dozens of drugs developed in part by A.I. proceeding in those trials. The number is much larger today, whether you choose to be impressed by the reported performance of ChatGPT on the LSAT or frustrated that Claude cannot solve logic problems intuitive to a kindergartner (or even reliably tell you whether 9.11 is greater than 9.9, as a Windows 95 calculator could).\\nAnd so if one account of this experience is that we are drowning in A.I. \\u201cpollution,\\u201d another perspective is that plenty of good news from A.I. is being drowned out by it, too. And perhaps that a more optimistic perspective can be drawn by analogy to what economists call the \\u201cenvironmental Kuznets curve,\\u201d which suggests that, as nations develop, they tend to first pollute a lot more and then, over time, as they grow richer, they ultimately pollute less.\\nEven in describing regular old pollution, this framework has its shortcomings, especially because it treats as automatic eventual progress that has always required tooth-and-nail fights against some very stubborn bad actors. As it happens, A.I. is generating an awful lot of genuine pollution, too \\u2014 both Google and Microsoft, which each pledged in 2019 to reach zero emissions by 2030, have instead expanded their carbon footprints by nearly 50 percent in the interim. The same political concerns about the ownership and control of A.I. tools, and how they might be turned toward harmful or exploitative ends, remain somewhat systematically unaddressed. And there are reasons to suspect that \\u201challucination\\u201d may be an unsolvable problem for generative A.I. as we know it.\\nWhich all suggests that the answer to the many problems of generative A.I. may not be what boosters call \\u201cscaling,\\u201d especially given the possibility that new training runs deliver some very expensive diminishing returns. It\\u2019s the matter of weeding out the good from the bad, in the name of intellectual hygiene. Hoel, the neuroscientist, has called for \\u201cthe equivalent of a Clean Air Act: a Clean Internet Act,\\u201d including the unscrubbable watermarking of anything produced by A.I. Actually scrubbing the slop would be even better.\\nAdvertisement\", \"source\": \"https://web.archive.org/web/20250522230739/https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/24/opinion/ai-annoying-future.html\", \"word_count\": 1321, \"sentiments\": [0.06686603590012682, 0.4646247397383761], \"polarity\": 0.06686603590012682, \"subjectivity\": 0.4646247397383761}, {\"_id\": 7, \"title\": \"How Businesses Can Avoid AI Slop | Entrepreneur\", \"excerpt\": \"AI slop is the latest iteration of digital clutter.

We pour everything into building something unique, something that truly resonates with our customers.\\nBut just as we've learned to dodge the nuisances of junk mail and spam, a new threat has emerged \\u2014 one that has the potential to undermine all our hard work: AI slop.\\nWhat is 'AI Slop'?\\nAI slop is the latest iteration of digital clutter. It's the content produced by AI tools that prioritize speed and quantity over substance and quality. Initially, platforms like ChatGPT and Google Gemini were celebrated for their efficiency. But as they've become more mainstream, they've also started churning out vast amounts of subpar content \\u2014 clogging blogs, social media and search results with noise instead of value.\\nFor entrepreneurs, this isn't just a nuisance; it's a potential threat to your brand's integrity and your ability to stand out in a crowded market.\\nRelated: These Days, Everything Is 'Powered By AI.' Here's How to Tell Hype From Real Innovation.\\nThe real cost of AI slop\\nAI slop comes in many forms, all of which can undermine your efforts to build a strong, authentic brand:\\n- Weak Brand Communications: Imagine your customers encountering repetitive, robotic responses from your chatbot \\u2014 like Air Canada's widely criticized AI mishaps. This kind of slop can erode trust and drive customers away.\\n- Cluttered Social Media Feeds: Social platforms should be a place for meaningful engagement, but AI slop often fills them with irrelevant, unengaging posts that fail to connect with your audience.\\n- Search Engine Confusion: Poorly generated search suggestions, such as Google's infamous recommendation of non-toxic glue for pizza cheese, highlight how AI's lack of context can lead to bizarre and off-putting user experiences.\\n- Misleading Information: Sloppy AI-generated snippets in search results can mislead your customers, making it harder for them to find accurate information.\\n- Generic Blog Content: Blogs filled with repetitive, unoriginal ideas don't just bore readers\\u2014they also undermine your authority and thought leadership.\\n- Inaccurate News: AI-generated news articles often miss critical nuances, leading to misinformation and damaging your credibility.\\n- Vague Product Descriptions: In e-commerce, product descriptions that are unclear or incorrect\\u2014sometimes even including disclaimers about AI use\\u2014can seriously hurt conversions.\\nThe threat of slop fatigue\\nAs consumers and business owners alike, we're all experiencing slop fatigue. The initial excitement over AI-generated content has faded, replaced by a demand for authenticity and real value. Your customers are becoming more discerning, and they're quick to tune out content that doesn't meet their expectations.\\nFor entrepreneurs, this shift is crucial. Authenticity is now a competitive advantage. The brands that prioritize genuine, high-quality content will not only survive in this new landscape but thrive.\\nHow entrepreneurs can spot AI slop\\nIdentifying AI slop is the first step in protecting your brand. Here's what to watch out for:\\n- Generic Phrasing: AI often relies on repetitive, uninspired language that lacks the creativity needed to engage.\\n- AI Art Mishaps: Distorted images and unnatural features in AI-generated visuals are telltale signs of low-quality output.\\n- Misinformation: Fact-checking is more important than ever. Content that seems plausible but inaccurate can harm your brand's reputation.\\n- Lack of Coherence: Content that jumps from one idea to another without a clear flow is often a product of AI slop.\\n- Repetitive Ideas: Redundant phrases and unoriginal concepts make content feel stale and unengaging.\\nRelated: How to Escape Entrepreneurial Burnout When You Can't Just Quit\\nStrategies to combat AI slop\\nTo safeguard your brand and ensure your content stands out, consider these strategies:\\n- Humanize Your Content: Infuse your content with personal stories, real-life examples and a touch of emotion. This approach not only makes your brand more relatable but also strengthens your connection with your audience.\\n- Invest in Originality: Set aside time to craft original content that reflects your unique perspective. Your insights and expertise differentiate your brand from the competition.\\n- Develop Custom AI Models: Creating AI models tailored to your specific needs and brand voice ensures that the content generated aligns with your standards.\\n- Combine AI with Human Touch: AI can be a powerful tool, but it's essential to have human editors refine and enhance the content to maintain quality and authenticity.\\n- Use Interactive Elements: Incorporate visuals, videos and interactive media to create engaging and dynamic content that holds your audience's attention.\\n- Highlight Creativity: Make sure your content showcases human creativity and originality. This adds depth and makes your brand memorable.\\nRelated: How to Spark Some Spontaneity in Your Hybrid Work Environment\\nMoving forward with the entrepreneurial edge\\nAs AI technology evolves, so do the challenges it presents. But with the right approach, you can turn these challenges into opportunities. By prioritizing quality, leveraging custom AI models and staying true to your brand's voice, you can rise above the slop and continue to deliver value that resonates with your audience.\\nIn a world saturated with AI-generated content, distinguishing valuable information from slop is not just a skill \\u2014 it's a competitive edge. Demand more from your AI tools, ensure they enhance rather than detract from your brand's message, and keep your content authentic.

But on some level you probably do.\\nSlop, at least in the fast-moving world of online message boards, is a broad term that has developed some traction in reference to shoddy or unwanted A.I. content in social media, art, books and, increasingly, in search results.\\nGoogle suggesting that you could add nontoxic glue to make cheese stick to a pizza? That\\u2019s slop. So is a low-price digital book that seems like the one you were looking for, but not quite. And those posts in your Facebook feed that seemingly came from nowhere? They\\u2019re slop as well.\\nThe term became more prevalent last month when Google incorporated its Gemini A.I. model into its U.S.-based search results. Rather than pointing users toward links, the service attempts to solve a query directly with an \\u201cA.I. Overview\\u201d \\u2014 a chunk of text at the top of a results page that uses Gemini to form its best guess at what the user is looking for.\\nThe change was a reaction to Microsoft having incorporated A.I. into its search results on Bing, and it had some immediate missteps, leading Google to declare it would roll back some of its A.I. features until problems can be ironed out.\\nBut with the dominant search engines having made A.I. a priority, it appears that vast quantities of information generated by machines, rather than largely curated by humans, will be served up as a daily part of life on the internet for the foreseeable future.\\nHence the term slop, which conjures images of heaps of unappetizing food being shoveled into troughs for livestock. Like that type of slop, A.I.-assisted search comes together quickly, but not necessarily in a way that critical thinkers can stomach.\\nKristian Hammond, the director of Northwestern University\\u2019s Center for Advancing Safety of Machine Intelligence, noted a problem in the current model: the information from A.I. Overview is being presented as a definitive answer, rather than as a place to start an internet user\\u2019s research into a given subject.\\n\\u201cYou search for something and you get back what you need in order to think \\u2014 and it actually encourages you to think,\\u201d Mr. Hammond said. \\u201cWhat it\\u2019s becoming, in this integration with language models, is something that does not encourage you to think. It encourages you to accept. And that, I think, is dangerous.\\u201d\\nFor a problem to be targeted, giving it a name can prove helpful. And while slop is one option, it is still an open question of whether it will catch on with a mainstream audience, or end up in the slang dustbin with cheugy, bae and skibidi.\\nAdam Aleksic, a linguist and content creator who uses the handle etymologynerd on social media, believes that slop \\u2014 which he said has yet to cross over to a broader audience \\u2014 shows promise.\\n\\u201cI think this is a great example of an unobtrusive word right now, because it is a word we\\u2019re all familiar with,\\u201d Mr. Aleksic said. \\u201cIt\\u2019s a word that feels like it\\u2019s naturally applicable to this situation. Therefore, it\\u2019s less in your face.\\u201d\\n@etymologynerd More great discussion of this in Alan Metcalf's book \\\"Predicting New Words\\\" #etymology #linguistics #language #memehistory #rizz #skibidi \\u266c original sound - etymologynerd\\nThe use of slop as a descriptor for low-grade A.I. material seemingly came about in reaction to the release of A.I. art generators in 2022. Some have identified Simon Willison, a developer, as an early adopter of the term \\u2014 but Mr. Willison, who has pushed for the phrase\\u2019s adoption, said it was in use long before he found it.\\n\\u201cI think I might actually have been quite late to the party!\\u201d he said in an email.\\nThe term has sprung up in 4chan, Hacker News and YouTube comments, where anonymous posters sometimes project their proficiency in complex subject matter by using in-group language.\\n\\u201cWhat we always see with any slang is that it starts in a niche community and then spreads from there,\\u201d Mr. Aleksic said. \\u201cUsually, coolness is a factor that helps it spread, but not necessarily.

Read the rest of the series.\\nTikTok, Facebook and other social media platforms are being flooded with uncanny and bizarre content generated with artificial intelligence (AI), from fake videos of the US government capturing vampires to images of shrimp Jesus.\\nGiven its outlandish nature and tenuous relationship with reality, you might think this so-called \\u201cAI slop\\u201d would quickly disappear. However, it shows no sign of abating.\\nIn fact, our research suggests this kind of low-quality AI-generated content is becoming a lucrative venture for the people who make it, the platforms that host it, and even a growing industry of middlemen teaching others how to get in on the AI gold rush.\\nWhen generative AI meets profiteers and platforms\\nThe short explanation for the prevalence of these baffling videos and images is that savvy creators on social media platforms have worked out how to use generative AI tools to earn a quick buck.\\nBut the full story is more complex. Platforms have created incentive programs for content that goes viral, and a whole ecosystem of content creators has arisen using generative AI to exploit these programs.\\nMuch of the conversation around generative AI tools focuses on how they enable ordinary people to \\u201ccreate\\u201d. Many earlier digital technologies have also made it easier to participate in creative activities, such as how smartphones made photography ubiquitous.\\nBut generative AI takes this a step further, as it can generate tailored images or videos from a simple text prompt. It makes content creation more accessible \\u2013 and also opens the floodgates to mass production on social media.\\nTo take just one example: if you search \\u201cpet dance motorcycle\\u201d on TikTok, you will find hundreds of AI-generated videos of animals doing the \\u201cmotorbike dance\\u201d, all animated using the same AI template. Some accounts post dozens of videos like this every day.\\nCreators and platforms are making money\\nYou may wonder why such repetitive, unimaginative content can go viral on TikTok. The answer lies in the platform\\u2019s own advice to aspiring creators: if you want your videos to be promoted, you should \\u201ccontinuously share fresh and diverse content\\u201d that \\u201cdoesn\\u2019t require a big production budget\\u201d.\\nYou may also wonder why some platforms don\\u2019t ban AI accounts for polluting the platform\\u2019s content stream. Other platforms such as Spotify and YouTube, which police intellectual property rights more aggressively than TikTok, invest considerable resources to identify and remove AI-generated content.\\nTikTok\\u2019s community guidelines do ban \\u201cinaccurate, misleading, or false content that may cause significant harm\\u201d, but AI-generated content \\u2013 at least for now \\u2013 does not qualify as causing \\u201csignificant harm\\u201d.\\nInstead, this kind of content has become important for platforms. Many of those \\u201cpet dance motorcycle\\u201d videos, for example, have been viewed tens of millions of times. As long as users are scrolling through videos, they are getting exposed to the ads that are the platforms\\u2019 primary source of income.\\nInside the AI \\u2018gold rush\\u2019\\nThere is also a growing industry of people teaching others how to make money using cheap AI content.\\nTake Xiaonan, a social media entrepreneur we interviewed who runs six different TikTok accounts, each with more than 100,000 followers. As he revealed in a live-streaming tutorial with more than 1,000 viewers, Xiaonan earned more than US$5,500 from TikTok in July alone.\\nXiaonan also hosts an exclusive chatting group where, for a fee, he reveals his most effective AI prompts, video headlines and hashtags tailored for different platforms including YouTube and Instagram. Xiaonan also reveals tricks for standing out in the platforms\\u2019 recommendation game and avoiding platform regulations.\\nXiaonan says he established his \\u201cAI side job\\u201d after being laid off by an internet company. He now works with two partners selling classes and tutorials on making AI-generated videos and other types of spam for profit.\\nCreators posting AI content may not be the kind of people we expect. As Xiaonan told us, many of the people taking his AI tutorial \\u2013 entitled \\u201cSide job, self-employed, high-paid\\u201d \\u2013 are housewives, unemployed people and college students.\\n\\u201cSome of us also do Uber driving or street vending,\\u201d one creator told us. AI-generated content has become the latest trend for earning side income.\\nThe rise of AI has coincided with global unemployment trends and the growth of the gig economy in the post-pandemic era.\\nMaking AI-generated content is more pleasant work than driving passengers or delivering food, according to a creator who is also a stay-at-home mother. It\\u2019s easy to learn, almost zero cost, and can be done any time at home with just a phone.\\nAs Xiaonan says, his method is to use AI to \\u201cearn from productivity gap\\u201d \\u2013 that is, by producing far more content than people who don\\u2019t use AI .\\nThe global AI-generated content factory\\nOur observations indicate many of these creators are from non-Western countries, such as India, Vietnam and China.\\nAs one Chinese social media influencer told us:\\nChina\\u2019s short video market is nearing saturation, which means you need to seek data traffic [viewers] on overseas platforms.\\nFor these entrepreneurs, AI is the secret sauce not only for creating viral content but also for circulating already-viral videos across different countries and platforms.\\nAn effective strategy mentioned by one creator is a kind of platform arbitrage involving popular videos from Douyin, the counterpart of TikTok in mainland China.\\nA creator will take one of these videos, add AI-generated translation, and post the result on TikTok. Despite clunky AI dubbing and error-riddled subtitles, many of these videos garner hundreds of thousands or even millions of views.\\nCreators often mute the original video and add AI-generated narration, translating the content into various languages, including French, Spanish, Portuguese, Indonesian and Swedish. These creators often manage several or even dozens of accounts, targeting viewers in different countries in a strategy known as an \\u201caccount matrix\\u201d.\\nThis is only the beginning\\nWe are only at the dawn of mainstream AI-generated content culture. We will soon face a situation in which content is effectively infinite, but human attention is still limited.\\nFor platforms, the challenge will be balancing the engagement these AI-driven trends bring with the need to maintain trust and authenticity.\\nSocial media platforms will soon respond. But before that, AI-generated content will continue to grow wildly \\u2013 at least for a while.\", \"source\": \"https://web.archive.org/web/20250530001956/http://theconversation.com/side-job-self-employed-high-paid-behind-the-ai-slop-flooding-tiktok-and-facebook-237638\", \"word_count\": 1056, \"sentiments\": [0.1823074974670719, 0.5135638297872341], \"polarity\": 0.1823074974670719, \"subjectivity\": 0.5135638297872341}, {\"_id\": 13, \"title\": \"Facebook\\u2019s Twisted Incentives Created Its AI Slop Era\", \"excerpt\": \"The social media giant's Creator Bonus Program has created a world where AI-generated spam is a business.\", \"author\": \"Matthew Gault\", \"source-hostname\": \"Gizmodo\", \"date\": \"2024-08-07\", \"text\": \"If you\\u2019ve spent any time on Facebook recently you\\u2019ve seen the river of AI slop.

Because there\\u2019s money in it, of course.\\nA new investigation from 404 Media dug into the origins of Facebook\\u2019s AI slop era and uncovered an ecosystem of YouTube videos, Telegram channels, and reel-filled Google drives. It exists to automate the creation and distribution of AI-generated images on Facebook.\\nPeople in places like Pakistan, India, Vietnam, Thailand, and Indonesia use tools like Microsoft\\u2019s AI Image Creator to churn out content. They post dozens of images every day, sometimes every hour, and make a living from the engagement.\\nThe goal is to get up as many posts in a day across as many accounts as possible. An account that\\u2019s consistently posting can get invited into Facebook\\u2019s Creator Bonus Program and start making money from viral content. Some posts will only generate a few cents while others may pull in hundreds of dollars. The more posts, the greater the returns. The goal is to use automation to post as much as possible, sometimes hundreds of times a day.\\nLike all spam circles, there\\u2019s a whole other economy filled with folks who will sell you the tools and knowledge you need to get started. There are YouTube channels dedicated to getting people\\u2019s AI slop machine up and running, dozens of guides on Fiverr and Gumroad, and Telegram channels full of simple English prompts that will help the AI image generator create a viral picture.\\nSome creators 404 Media uncovered were running multiple Facebook accounts and used automated tools to fill the feeds with spammy engagement-bait images. Using instructions and tools he bought online, 404 Media\\u2019s Jason Koebler set up his own AI slop shop. Here\\u2019s how it works:\\n\\u201cFirst, a spammer makes a free Vercel account. Then they make a WordPress account and spam page, download a snippet of code from GitHub that has been written by other spammers, modify it (there are guides for this on GumRoad and Fiverr; I bought guides on both), and install it on their Vercel deployment. Then they connect Vercel to the WordPress website using a specific WordPress plugin that effectively sets up a redirect between Vercel and the WordPress site. Then the person logs into their Facebook page and upgrades their account to an ad account, which is an instant process. Then the person goes through the process of buying and setting up an ad on Facebook that links to the Vercel mirror of the page they want to link to.\\nThis entire Vercel step exists to avoid Facebook\\u2019s automated spam detection, because it ultimately masks the link of the website that is being linked to. Within the ad manager, they upload an image that has been modified to look like a Facebook gallery post (there are tools for this), and then they delete the headline and description that is autogenerated by Facebook to make it look like the ad is just an image and not a link. Then, they generate a preview for their ad. This creates a preview link, which can then be pushed to their phone (it has to be a separate device), then shared to their own personal Facebook page as a \\u2018test.\\u2019\\nFrom there, the link can be grabbed and shared to a page as a normal post, even though it is not a published ad, meaning that, to do this trick, you do not actually have to spend any money. This process can then be repeated over and over again to effectively rick people into clicking on photo albums that are not actually photo albums. FewFeed has recently created a feature that allows you to directly create these fake photo album-type images.\\u201d\\nProfiting from AI slop is a technical process and Meta\\u2019s content moderation teams can\\u2019t keep up with the flood. Worse, they may not want to stop all grist-mill. Meta explicitly allows AI-generated images and the only metrics it cares about are the ones that improve its bottom line. The more people sharing posts and engaging with them, the better off Meta is. The slop makes everyone money.\\n\\u201cWe encourage creators to use AI tools to produce high-quality content that meets all our Community Standards, and we take action against those who attempt to drive traffic using inauthentic engagement whether they use AI or not,\\u201d a Meta spokesperson told 404 Media. \\u201cWe know bad actors adapt their tactics to evade our rules, so we are always working to improve our detection and enforcement.\\u201d\\nAccording to the people making the slop, the money is life-changing. Buried in the middle of the 404 Media story is a telling exchange. In one podcast, a spammer showed off his earnings tab. On the list was a picture of a train made of leaves. The spammer had earned $431 from the image\\u2019s engagement. \\u201cPeople don\\u2019t even make this much money in a month,\\u201d the interview said.\", \"source\": \"https://web.archive.org/web/20250530001956/https://gizmodo.com/facebooks-twisted-incentives-created-its-ai-slop-era-2000484110\", \"word_count\": 839, \"sentiments\": [0.11672727272727271, 0.5129004329004331], \"polarity\": 0.11672727272727271, \"subjectivity\": 0.5129004329004331}, {\"_id\": 14, \"title\": \"The MAGA Aesthetic Is AI Slop\", \"excerpt\": \"Far-right influencers are flooding social media with a new kind of junk.\", \"author\": \"Charlie Warzel\", \"source-hostname\": \"The Atlantic\", \"date\": \"2024-08-21\", \"text\": \"The MAGA Aesthetic Is AI Slop\\nFar-right influencers are flooding social media with a new kind of junk.\\nProduced by ElevenLabs and News Over Audio (Noa) using AI narration. Listen to more stories on the Noa app.\\nTaylor Swift fans are not endorsing Donald Trump en masse. Kamala Harris did not give a speech at the Democratic National Convention to a sea of communists while standing in front of the hammer and sickle. Hillary Clinton was not recently seen walking around Chicago in a MAGA hat. But images of all these things exist.\\nIn recent weeks, far-right corners of social media have been clogged with such depictions, created with generative-AI tools. You can spot them right away, as they bear the technology\\u2019s distinct image style: not-quite-but-almost photorealistic, frequently outrageous, not so dissimilar from a tabloid illustration. Donald Trump\\u2014or at least whoever controls his social-media accounts\\u2014posted the AI-generated photo of Harris with the hammer and sickle, as well as a series of fake images depicting Taylor Swift dressed as Uncle Sam and young women marching in Swifties for Trump shirts. (This after he falsely claimed that Harris had posted an image that had been \\u201cA.I.\\u2019d\\u201d\\u2014a tidy bit of projection.)\\nTrump himself has been the subject of generative-AI art and has shared depictions of himself going back to March 2023. He\\u2019s often dressed up as a gun-toting cowboy or in World War II fatigues, storming a beach. Yet these are anodyne compared with much of the material created and shared by far-right influencers and shitposters. There are plenty of mocking or degrading images of Harris and other female Democratic politicians, such as Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. On X, one post that included a fake image in which Harris is implied to be a sex worker has been viewed more than 3.5 million times; on Facebook, that same post has been shared more than 87,000 times. One pro-Trump, Elon-Musk-fanboy account recently shared a suggestive image depicting a scantily clad Harris surrounded by multiple clones of Donald Trump; it\\u2019s been viewed 1.6 million times. There are images and videos of Harris and Trump holding hands on a beach and Harris wearing a crown that reads Inflation Queen. On the first night of the DNC, MAGA influencers such as Catturd2 and Jack Posobiec supplemented their rage tweets about Democrats with stylized AI images of Tim Walz and Joe Biden looking enraged.\\nAlthough no one ideology has a monopoly on AI art, the high-resolution, low-budget look of generative-AI images appears to be fusing with the meme-loving aesthetic of the MAGA movement. At least in the fever swamps of social media, AI art is becoming MAGA-coded. The GOP is becoming the party of AI slop.\\nAI slop isn\\u2019t, by nature, political. It is most prevalent on platforms such as Facebook, where click farmers and spammers create elaborate networks to flood pages and groups with cheap, fake images of starving children and Shrimp Jesus in the hopes of going viral, getting likes, and picking up \\u201ccreator bonuses\\u201d for online engagement. Jason Koebler, a technology reporter who has spent the past year investigating Facebook\\u2019s AI-slop economy, has described the deluge of artificial imagery as part of a \\u201czombie internet\\u201d and \\u201cthe end of a shared reality,\\u201d where \\u201ca mix of bots, humans, and accounts that were once humans but aren\\u2019t anymore interact to form a disastrous website where there is little social connection at all.\\u201d\\nWhat\\u2019s going on across the MAGA internet isn\\u2019t exactly the same as Facebook\\u2019s spam situation, although the vibe is similar. MAGA influencers may be shitposting AI photos for fun, but they\\u2019re also engagement farming, especially on X, where premium subscribers can opt in to the platform\\u2019s revenue-sharing program. Right-wing influencers have been vocal about these bonuses, which are handed out based on how many times a creator\\u2019s content is seen in a given month. \\u201cPayout was huge. They\\u2019ve been getting bigger,\\u201d Catturd2 posted this March, while praising Musk.\\nAlthough many of these influencers already have sizable followings, AI-image generators offer an inveterate poster the thing they need most: cheap, fast, on-demand fodder for content. Rather than peck out a few sentences complaining about Biden\\u2019s age or ridiculing Harris\\u2019s economic policies, far-right posters can illustrate their attacks and garner more attention. And it\\u2019s only getting easier to do this: Last week, X incorporated the newest iteration of the generative-AI engine Grok, which operates with fewer guardrails than some competing models and has already conjured up untold illustrations of celebrities and politicians in compromising situations.\\nIt\\u2019s helpful to think of these photos and illustrations not as nefarious deepfakes or even hyper-persuasive propaganda, but as digital chum\\u2014Shrimp Jesus on the campaign trail. For now, little (if any) of what\\u2019s being generated is convincing enough to fool voters, and most of it is being used to confirm the priors of true believers. Still, the glut of AI-created political imagery is a pollutant in a broader online information ecosystem. This AI slop doesn\\u2019t just exist in a vacuum of a particular social network: It leaves an ecological footprint of sorts on the web. The images are created, copied, shared, and embedded into websites; they are indexed into search engines. It\\u2019s possible that, later on, AI-art tools will train on these distorted depictions, creating warped, digitally inbred representations of historical figures. The very existence of so much quickly produced fake imagery adds a layer of unreality to the internet. You and I, like voters everywhere, must wade through this layer of junk, wearily separating out what\\u2019s patently fake, what\\u2019s real, and what exists in the murky middle.\\nIn many ways, political slop is a logical end point for these image generators, which seem most useful for people trying to make a quick buck. Photography, illustration, and graphic design previously required skill or, at the very least, time to create something interesting enough to attract attention, which, online, can be converted into real money. Now free or easily affordable tools have flooded the market. What once took expert labor is now spam, powered by tools trained on the output of real artists and photographers. Spam is annoying, but ultimately easy to ignore\\u2014that is, until it collides with the negative incentives of social-media platforms, where it\\u2019s used by political shitposters and hucksters. Then the images become something else. In the hands of Trump, they create small news cycles and narratives to be debunked. In the hands of influencers, they are fired at our timelines in a scattershot approach to attract a morsel of attention. As with the Facebook AI-slop farms, social media shock jocks churning out obviously fake, low-quality images don\\u2019t care whether they\\u2019re riling up real people, boring them, or creating fodder for bots and other spammers. It is engagement for engagement\\u2019s sake. Mindlessly generated information chokes our information pathways, forcing consumers to do the work of discarding it.\\nThat these tools should end up as the medium of choice for Trump\\u2019s political movement makes sense, too. It stands to reason that a politician who, for many years, has spun an unending series of lies into a patchwork alternate reality would gravitate toward a technology that allows one to, with a brief prompt, rewrite history so that it flatters him.

Listen to more stories on the Noa app.\\nSign up for The Decision, a newsletter featuring our 2024 election coverage.\\nFor me, it\\u2019s the amber glow of the fry machine gently illuminating the exhausted 45th president of the United States of America. The glare of the potato-warming apparatus casts a shadow on the left side of Donald Trump\\u2019s face as he works at a McDonald\\u2019s in Bucks County, Pennsylvania. This man, who held the nuclear codes just 1,369 days ago, is now wearing an apron and doling out fast food.\\nThe images of Trump\\u2019s McDonald\\u2019s stunt\\u2014in which he jiggled the fryer and handed burgers out of a window yesterday\\u2014are uncanny. There\\u2019s Trump, face contorted in the appearance of deep concentration, tilting a fry basket to the heavens; Trump hanging two-thirds of the way out a drive-through window, waving like a beleaguered Norman Rockwell character; Trump, mouth agape, appearing to yell into the middle distance of a fast-food parking lot. The shadows of the McDonald\\u2019s kitchen, the interplay between the sheen of the stainless steel and the cast of the nugget-warming lights, give the very real photos a distinct Midjourney aesthetic. These pictures immediately reminded me of the viral, glossy AI-generated images of Trump being arrested and thrown in jail that started circulating in the spring of 2023.\\nPerhaps it\\u2019s because my feeds have been simultaneously clogged with election-season garbage and AI-generated slop, but the McDonald\\u2019s photoshoot struck me as a moment of strange synthesis, where reality and tech-enabled fiction felt somehow mashed together by the internet\\u2019s cultural particle accelerator. Trump proffering Dollar Menu items isn\\u2019t AI, but it is still slop in all the ways that matter: a hastily staged depiction of a fairly stupid, though entertaining fantasy, meant to delight, troll, and, most important, emphasize a false impression of the candidate.\\nThis is clarifying, insofar that it demonstrates that Trump\\u2019s primary output is always a kind of slop. Slop, as it relates to AI, is loosely defined as spammy, cheap blocks of text, video, or images, quickly generated by computer programs for mass distribution. But nonsynthetic slop is everywhere too. What is a Trump rally but a teleprompter reading of stump-speech slop, interspersed with inexplicable lorem ipsum about Hannibal Lecter and wind turbines spun up by the unknowable language model in Trump\\u2019s own head? What are Trump\\u2019s tweets and Truth Social shitposts if not slop morsels, hurled into the internet\\u2019s ether for the rest of us to react to? And what is the Trump campaign producing if not fantastical propaganda intended to conjure a false image of Joe Biden\\u2019s America as a dark, dangerous place on the verge of destruction, besieged by immigrants, and savable only by one heroic man? (For instance, earlier today, Trump posted an AI-generated picture of himself as a buff Pittsburgh Steelers lineman.) The McDonald\\u2019s photo op was barely real: The restaurant was closed to the public during Trump\\u2019s visit. He ignored a question about the minimum wage. Only prescreened customers were allowed in the drive-through, and those customers were not able to place orders\\u2014they just took whatever Trump handed to them. Like any good AI slop, the op illustrated a fantasy\\u2014in this case, that Trump, a man who has long lived in a gilded penthouse, is a working-class man.\\nIn August, I wrote that AI slop is now the aesthetic of the far-right and MAGA coalition, in part because it allows hyper-partisans to illustrate the fictional universe they\\u2019ve been peddling and living in for the past decade-plus. But MAGA world has always trafficked in slop. Old memes depicted \\u201cGod Emperor\\u201d Trump. Right-wing artists including Ben Garrison and Jon McNaughton have long illustrated Trump in an absurd light\\u2014hulking and hypermasculine or holding a lantern on a boat, like George Washington crossing the Delaware. This was proto-slop, for a simpler, more analog time.\\nSlop isn\\u2019t necessarily a commentary on quality so much as on how it is meant to be consumed: fleetingly, and with little or no thought beyond the initial limbic-system response. The main characteristic of slop is that there is an endless supply of it. And so it makes sense that campaigns\\u2014not just Trump\\u2019s\\u2014tend to traffic in it. Campaigns are nothing if not aggressive, often-desperate content farms hoping to get attention. In service of that mission, they meme, pander, email, and text, frequently in cringeworthy fashion. Not unlike the fast food that Trump was hawking, slop is sometimes delicious, but it is never nutrient dense.\\nAI slop has clogged the internet with synthetic ephemera, but it has also given a name to the human-made attentional grist that\\u2019s all around us\\u2014the slop that exists in real life, in meatspace. Trump was really at that Buck\\u2019s County McDonald\\u2019s, debasing himself for swing-state votes in the same way that candidates have for generations (see: Rick Perry eating a corn dog in 2011). Presidential campaigning has long offered an unreal portrait of American life\\u2014it\\u2019s just been made more peculiar by the presence of Trump.\\nIf AI slop can teach us something about a man like Trump, it seems that the opposite is also true. In the lead-up to the candidate\\u2019s fast-food stop, various news outlets, fans, and even T-shirt sellers used generative-AI tools to mock up what the visit might look like. The photos aren\\u2019t terribly far off (a few of them accurately placed Trump in an apron), but all of them seem to be trying too hard. In some, Trump\\u2019s clothing is too garish; in others, he\\u2019s toting a comically large amount of food. None capture the awkward banality of the candidate\\u2019s actual campaign stop. In his own way, Trump has shown us all the limits of artificial intelligence. Computers, at least for now, cannot quite capture the crushing surreality and maddening absurdity of modern electoral politics.\", \"source\": \"https://web.archive.org/web/20250530001956/https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2024/10/donald-trump-mcdonalds/680324/\", \"word_count\": 971, \"sentiments\": [0.06830990438133297, 0.49475500689786395], \"polarity\": 0.06830990438133297, \"subjectivity\": 0.49475500689786395}, {\"_id\": 16, \"title\": \"How did Donald Trump end up posting Taylor Swift deepfakes?\", \"excerpt\": \"AI images posted to Truth Social bore the watermark of a tiny Texas non-profit looking to bankroll X users\", \"author\": \"Nick Robins-Early\", \"source-hostname\": \"The Guardian\", \"date\": \"2024-08-26\", \"text\": \"When Donald Trump shared a slew of AI-generated images this week that falsely depicted Taylor Swift and her fans endorsing his campaign for president, the former US president was amplifying the work of a murky non-profit with aspirations to bankroll rightwing media influencers and a history of spreading misinformation.\\nSeveral of the images Trump posted on his Truth Social platform, which showed digitally rendered young women in \\u201cSwifties for Trump\\u201d T-shirts, were the products of the John Milton Freedom Foundation.

The Milton Freedom Foundation is one of many small groups flooding social media with so-called AI slop.\\nA niche non-profit\\u2019s AI slop makes its way to Trump\\nDuring the spike in AI images on X, the conservative @amuse account posted the images of AI-generated Swift fans to more than 300,000 followers. On the text of the post, which was labeled \\u201csatire\\u201d, was a watermark that stated it was \\u201csponsored by the John Milton Freedom Foundation\\u201d. Trump posted a screenshot of @amuse\\u2019s tweet on Truth Social.\\nThe @amuse account has considerable reach itself, with about 390,000 followers on X and dozens of daily posts. Running @amuse appears to be Alexander Muse, listed as a consultant in the investor prospectus of the Milton Foundation, who also writes a rightwing commentary Substack that includes posts exploring election conspiracy theories. The @amuse account has numerous connections with Muse. The X account is connected to a Substack posting the same articles that Muse publishes on his LinkedIn page, which also has the username \\u201camuse\\u201d, reflecting his first initial and last name. Muse\\u2019s book on how to secure startup funding, which includes examples of him asking ChatGPT to pretend it\\u2019s Musk and offer business advice, lists that same Substack account as its publisher.\\nProminent accounts including Musk have shared and replied to @amuse\\u2019s posts, which recently have included AI depictions of Trump fighting Darth Vader and sexualized imagery of Harris. Its banner picture is currently an AI-generated photo of Trump surrounded by women in \\u201cSwifties\\u201d shirts. The account posts misleading, pro-Trump headlines such as claiming Harris turned hundreds of thousands of children over to human traffickers as \\u201cborder czar\\u201d. The headlines, like the AI-generated Swifties for Trump images, come with the watermark \\u201csponsored by the John Milton Freedom Foundation\\u201d.\\nThe John Milton Freedom Foundation, named after the 17th-century British poet and essayist, has a small online footprint: a website, an investor prospectus and an X account with fewer than 500 followers. The team behind it, according to its own documents, consists of five people based in the Dallas-Fort Worth area with varying degrees of experience in Republican politics.

These include people like the former CBS journalist turned far-right star Lara Logan, who was cut from Newsmax in recent years for going on a QAnon-inspired rant that claimed world leaders drink children\\u2019s blood, as well as the author of an anti-trans children\\u2019s book. The organization believes that this money would allow these already established influencers to \\u201cincrease their reach by more than 10x in less than a year\\u201d, according to its investor prospectus.\\nWhile only one of the fellows listed on the foundation\\u2019s site mentions the organization on their X profiles and none follow its account, the @amuse account has a prominent link to the group\\u2019s community page and the foundation often engages with its posts.\\nIt is not clear that the foundation has any money to give and if all the media influencers listed as its 2024 fellowship class know about the organization. One Texas-based account that posts anti-vaccine content lists itself as a \\u201cJMFF\\u201d fellow in their bio, but none of the others advertise any connection.

Listen to more stories on the Noa app.\\nUpdated at 9:43 a.m. ET on October 11, 2024\\nThe truth is, it\\u2019s getting harder to describe the extent to which a meaningful percentage of Americans have dissociated from reality. As Hurricane Milton churned across the Gulf of Mexico last night, I saw an onslaught of outright conspiracy theorizing and utter nonsense racking up millions of views across the internet. The posts would be laughable if they weren\\u2019t taken by many people as gospel. Among them: Infowars\\u2019 Alex Jones, who claimed that Hurricanes Milton and Helene were \\u201cweather weapons\\u201d unleashed on the East Coast by the U.S. government, and \\u201ctruth seeker\\u201d accounts on X that posted photos of condensation trails in the sky to baselessly allege that the government was \\u201cspraying Florida ahead of Hurricane Milton\\u201d in order to ensure maximum rainfall, \\u201cjust like they did over Asheville!\\u201d\\nAs Milton made landfall, causing a series of tornados, a verified account on X reposted a TikTok video of a massive funnel cloud with the caption \\u201cWHAT IS HAPPENING TO FLORIDA?!\\u201d The clip, which was eventually removed but had been viewed 662,000 times as of yesterday evening, turned out to be from a video of a CGI tornado that was originally published months ago. Scrolling through these platforms, watching them fill with false information, harebrained theories, and doctored images\\u2014all while panicked residents boarded up their houses, struggled to evacuate, and prayed that their worldly possessions wouldn\\u2019t be obliterated overnight\\u2014offered a portrait of American discourse almost too bleak to reckon with head-on.\\nEven in a decade marred by online grifters, shameless politicians, and an alternative right-wing-media complex pushing anti-science fringe theories, the events of the past few weeks stand out for their depravity and nihilism. As two catastrophic storms upended American cities, a patchwork network of influencers and fake-news peddlers have done their best to sow distrust, stoke resentment, and interfere with relief efforts. But this is more than just a misinformation crisis. To watch as real information is overwhelmed by crank theories and public servants battle death threats is to confront two alarming facts: first, that a durable ecosystem exists to ensconce citizens in an alternate reality, and second, that the people consuming and amplifying those lies are not helpless dupes but willing participants.\\nSome of the lies and obfuscation are politically motivated, such as the claim that FEMA is offering only $750 in total to hurricane victims who have lost their home. (In reality, FEMA offers $750 as immediate \\u201cSerious Needs Assistance\\u201d to help people get basic supplies such as food and water.) Donald Trump, J. D. Vance, and Fox News have all repeated that lie. Trump also posted (and later deleted) on Truth Social that FEMA money was given to undocumented migrants, which is untrue. Elon Musk, who owns X, claimed\\u2014without evidence\\u2014that FEMA was \\u201cactively blocking shipments and seizing goods and services locally and locking them away to state they are their own. It\\u2019s very real and scary how much they have taken control to stop people helping.\\u201d That post has been viewed more than 40 million times. Other influencers, such as the Trump sycophant Laura Loomer, have urged their followers to disrupt the disaster agency\\u2019s efforts to help hurricane victims. \\u201cDo not comply with FEMA,\\u201d she posted on X. \\u201cThis is a matter of survival.\\u201d\\nThe result of this fearmongering is what you might expect. Angry, embittered citizens have been harassing government officials in North Carolina, as well as FEMA employees. According to an analysis by the Institute for Strategic Dialogue, an extremism-research group, \\u201cFalsehoods around hurricane response have spawned credible threats and incitement to violence directed at the federal government,\\u201d including \\u201ccalls to send militias to face down FEMA.\\u201d The study also found that 30 percent of the X posts analyzed by ISD \\u201ccontained overt antisemitic hate, including abuse directed at public officials such as the Mayor of Asheville, North Carolina; the FEMA Director of Public Affairs; and the Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security.\\u201d The posts received a collective 17.1 million views as of October 7.\\nOnline, first responders are pleading with residents, asking for their help to combat the flood of lies and conspiracy theories. FEMA Administrator Deanne Criswell said that the volume of misinformation could hamper relief efforts. \\u201cIf it creates so much fear that my staff doesn\\u2019t want to go out in the field, then we\\u2019re not going to be in a position where we can help people,\\u201d she said in a news conference on Tuesday. In Pensacola, North Carolina, Assistant Fire Chief Bradley Boone vented his frustrations on Facebook: \\u201cI\\u2019m trying to rescue my community,\\u201d he said in a livestream. \\u201cI ain\\u2019t got time. I ain\\u2019t got time to chase down every Facebook rumor \\u2026 We\\u2019ve been through enough.\\u201d\\nIt is difficult to capture the nihilism of the current moment. The pandemic saw Americans, distrustful of authority, trying to discredit effective vaccines, spreading conspiracy theories, and attacking public-health officials. But what feels novel in the aftermath of this month\\u2019s hurricanes is how the people doing the lying aren\\u2019t even trying to hide the provenance of their bullshit. Similarly, those sharing the lies are happy to admit that they do not care whether what they\\u2019re pushing is real or not. Such was the case last week, when Republican politicians shared an AI-generated viral image of a little girl holding a puppy while supposedly fleeing Helene. Though the image was clearly fake and quickly debunked, some politicians remained defiant. \\u201cY\\u2019all, I don\\u2019t know where this photo came from and honestly, it doesn\\u2019t matter,\\u201d Amy Kremer, who represents Georgia on the Republican National Committee, wrote after sharing the fake image. \\u201cI\\u2019m leaving it because it is emblematic of the trauma and pain people are living through right now.\\u201d\\nKremer wasn\\u2019t alone. The journalist Parker Molloy compiled screenshots of people \\u201cacknowledging that this image is AI but still insisting that it\\u2019s real on some deeper level\\u201d\\u2014proof, Molloy noted, that we\\u2019re \\u201cliving in the post-reality.\\u201d The technology writer Jason Koebler argued that we\\u2019ve entered the \\u201c\\u2018Fuck It\\u2019 Era\\u201d of AI slop and political messaging, with AI-generated images being used to convey whatever partisan message suits the moment, regardless of truth.\\nThis has all been building for more than a decade. On The Colbert Report, back in 2005, Stephen Colbert coined the word truthiness, which he defined as \\u201cthe belief in what you feel to be true rather than what the facts will support.\\u201d This reality-fracturing is the result of an information ecosystem that is dominated by platforms that offer financial and attentional incentives to lie and enrage, and to turn every tragedy and large event into a shameless content-creation opportunity. This collides with a swath of people who would rather live in an alternate reality built on distrust and grievance than change their fundamental beliefs about the world. But the misinformation crisis is not always what we think it is.\\nSo much of the conversation around misinformation suggests that its primary job is to persuade. But as Michael Caulfield, an information researcher at the University of Washington, has argued, \\u201cThe primary use of \\u2018misinformation\\u2019 is not to change the beliefs of other people at all. Instead, the vast majority of misinformation is offered as a service for people to maintain their beliefs in face of overwhelming evidence to the contrary.\\u201d This distinction is important, in part because it assigns agency to those who consume and share obviously fake information. What is clear from comments such as Kremer\\u2019s is that she is not a dupe; although she may come off as deeply incurious and shameless, she is publicly admitting to being an active participant in the far right\\u2019s world-building project, where feel is always greater than real.\\nWhat we\\u2019re witnessing online during and in the aftermath of these hurricanes is a group of people desperate to protect the dark, fictitious world they\\u2019ve built. Rather than deal with the realities of a warming planet hurling once-in-a-generation storms at them every few weeks, they\\u2019d rather malign and threaten meteorologists, who, in their minds, are \\u201cnothing but a trained subversive liar programmed to spew stupid shit to support the global warming bullshit,\\u201d as one X user put it. It is a strategy designed to silence voices of reason, because those voices threaten to expose the cracks in their current worldview. But their efforts are doomed, futile. As one dispirited meteorologist wrote on X this week, \\u201cMurdering meteorologists won\\u2019t stop hurricanes.\\u201d She followed with: \\u201cI can\\u2019t believe I just had to type that.\\u201d\\nWhat is clear is that a new framework is needed to describe this fracturing. Misinformation is too technical, too freighted, and, after almost a decade of Trump, too political. Nor does it explain what is really happening, which is nothing less than a cultural assault on any person or institution that operates in reality. If you are a weatherperson, you\\u2019re a target. The same goes for journalists, election workers, scientists, doctors, and first responders. These jobs are different, but the thing they share is that they all must attend to and describe the world as it is. This makes them dangerous to people who cannot abide by the agonizing constraints of reality, as well as those who have financial and political interests in keeping up the charade.\\nIn one sense, these attacks\\u2014and their increased desperation\\u2014make sense. The world feels dark; for many people, it\\u2019s tempting to meet that with a retreat into the delusion that they\\u2019ve got everything figured out, that the powers that be have conspired against them directly. But in turning away, they exacerbate a crisis that has characterized the Trump era, one that will reverberate to Election Day and beyond. Americans are divided not just by political beliefs but by whether they believe in a shared reality\\u2014or desire one at all.\\nThis article previously stated that Bradley Boone is the assistant fire chief in Pensacola, Florida.

The reaction online has been overwhelmingly negative, with comments on the YouTube video and across social media calling it \\\"slop,\\\" \\\"embarrassing,\\\" and \\\"creepy.\\\" Or, as one commenter put it: \\\"This is as heartwarming as an aluminum tree.\\\"\\n\\\"Over 14 years ago, people were recreating the Coca Cola Christmas ad in GTA San Andreas and it still came off as more authentic than this tripe,\\\" wrote one X/Twitter user.\\nOver 14 years ago, people were recreating the Coca Cola Christmas ad in GTA San Andreas and it still came off as more authentic than this tripe. https://t.co/3BmQWBP3uF pic.twitter.com/rXZ81kkEhN\\n\\u2014 \\ud835\\udd11\\ud835\\udd1e\\ud835\\udd31\\ud835\\udd25\\ud835\\udd1e\\ud835\\udd2b (@TheNathanNS) November 15, 2024\\n\\\"Coca Cola decided to have its polar bears take a giant AI shit under the Christmas Tree,\\\" wrote @joerussotweets on X/Twitter.\\n\\\"It\\u2019s actually soooo concerning that a brand as big as Coca Cola is doing this,\\\" added another X/Twitter user. \\\"Surely they could\\u2019ve afforded to hire actors/designers/editors/etc. to make this?\\\"\\nOthers expressed similar concerns: \\\"This is such slop bro.

But Jason Zada, founder of one of the three AI studios Coca-Cola worked with to create the ad, touted the efficiency of using the technology to craft the spot.\\n\\u201cMore than cost, it\\u2019s the speed,\\u201d Thakar told Ad Age. \\u201cSpeed is I would say five times, right?

The robotic voice, familiar to anyone who frequents YouTube Shorts, Instagram Reels, or TikTok, is generally associated with low-effort, mass-produced AI content. The script itself feels stilted and detached, raising the obvious question: why wouldn't Paramount just hire a voice actor?\\nFeedback in the comments is rightfully resistant to the content, highlighting:\\n\\\"Imagine how many up and coming voice actors would've literally jumped at the chance to narrate this video for free.\\\"\\n\\\"Disgusting application of AI.\\\"\\nFor context, Paramount Global is a company valued at $13.6 billion.

Coca-Cola had a similar misfire with its AI-generated Christmas ad, which paid homage to its 1995 \\u201cHolidays are coming\\u201d commercial. The ad, which was created in collaboration with three AI studios, features AI-generated animals and red Coca-Cola lorries. But, instead of reviving the holiday magic of the original commercial, the AI advert sparked backlash online. Not only were the ethics of the endeavour questioned, the advert\\u2019s quality was pulled apart and branded \\u2018soulless\\u2019 and \\u2018devoid of any actual creativity\\u2019.\\nOf course, Spotify and Coca-Cola aren\\u2019t alone in receiving criticism for outsourcing creativity to algorithms. Toys \\u201cR\\u201d Us provoked controversy with an AI-generated ad in April last year. Hipster movie production company A24, meanwhile, was called out for using AI to create promotional posters for Alex Garland\\u2019s dystopian film Civil War. This week, the Labour Party has faced criticism for its TikTok video featuring AI-generated animals.\\nThese examples aren\\u2019t anomalies and they speak to a larger issue: a fundamental misunderstanding of how to use AI.\\nAI is a double-edged sword\\nIn the rush to embrace AI, brands risk leaving their critical-thinking skills behind. The public is more concerned with the outcome than the process. Most people aren\\u2019t interested in whether the latest cutting-edge systems have been deployed if the result is clumsy, generic and flat.\\nConsumers are becoming increasingly intolerant of AI-generated missteps, even from their favourite brands. This year\\u2019s backlashes highlights a key risk for businesses adopting AI in 2025. Using automation in the wrong places has the power to turn your most loyal fans into vocal critics.\\nUsing AI the right way\\nBut using AI is not a mistake in itself, the problem is how brands choose to harness it. For example, generative AI cannot replace genuine human creativity \\u2013 it is merely a mulch of previous human ideas. What made Spotify Wrapped genius wasn\\u2019t its super-specific genres but its ability to encourage connection and reflection among users. There\\u2019s currently no code for that.\\nThis isn\\u2019t to say that AI should automatically be removed from the creative sphere. There is a role for technology to play in this space. The key is to apply the right models to the right use cases. For instance, AI can be used to automate repetitive, low-value tasks, freeing up time for teams to focus on high-value, strategic initiatives. By leveraging AI in this way, businesses can enhance productivity, without delegating their most important tasks to tech that isn\\u2019t suited to the task.\\nIf brands want to reap the full benefit of AI, they should also take a closer look at their data. Successful AI models run on high-quality, well-governed data, so getting this in order should be top of the agenda for 2025. Businesses should be checking their data is accurately labelled and properly secured, ensuring sensitive data is only accessible to those who need it.\\nAs adoption becomes more widespread, we\\u2019re likely to see brands churn out more AI slop. But the future is not without hope. If businesses can learn from their peers\\u2019 mistakes and apply AI in the right way, they\\u2019ll have an opportunity to enhance their offering, rather than become an example of bad use cases. Wrapped 2024\\u2019s end-of-year offering may have been as entertaining as receiving a lump of coal for Christmas, but if Spotify can learn from its misstep, it may prove the greatest gift yet.\\nPaul Maker is chief technology officer at Aiimi.\\nMany Spotify users eagerly await the annual review of their listening habits shown in Spotify Wrapped.

They\\u2019re not just jumping on trends \\u2014 they\\u2019re showing they\\u2019re in on the joke.\\u201d\\nAccording to research by GWI, 76% of Gen Z uses TikTok to watch funny videos, and Lifewire reports 57% prefer short videos for product research. Italian Brainrot hits the sweet spot: it\\u2019s fast, memeable, and demands zero cognitive load. Scroll, laugh, forget, repeat.\\nBut the article warns: virality is not strategy. Brands that only copy trends risk becoming forgettable. \\u201cRyanair succeeds not because they post Brainrot content,\\u201d De Nittis writes, \\u201cbut because their version is still very Ryanair \\u2014 cheap, cheeky, and chaotic. That\\u2019s brand distinctiveness in action.\\u201d\\nThe formula is simple but powerful:\\nTrend + Brand Distinctiveness = Memorable Impact\\nThe article urges marketers to ask themselves:\\n\\u2022 Do we know our brand well enough to play with chaos?\\n\\u2022 Does the trend reinforce or contradict our positioning?\\n\\u2022 Can we insert our product without feeling forced?\\nFor brands with answers, the payoff can be immense. For those without, chasing trends can quickly backfire.\\nAbout Human Centric Group\\nHuman Centric Group is a boutique branding agency based in London, working with global leaders like Danone, Ikea, PepsiCo, and Carlsberg.

Production company House of Illuminati has issued a statement on Facebook apologizing for the event and attempting to explain how it came to pass.\\nThe statement, written in the first person, is not signed; it does not explain how the writer is affiliated with House of Illuminati. But the mystery writer does apologize and take full responsibility for the event. \\u201cI want to make it clear that anyone who was hired externally or offered their help, are not affiliated with the me or the company, any use of faces can cause serious harm to those who did not have any involvement in the making of this event,\\u201d they add.\\nThe statement also refers, puzzlingly, to a marriage ceremony that has been either canceled or postponed as a result of the event\\u2019s failure. \\u201cRegarding a personal matter, there will be no wedding, and no wedding was funded by the ticket sales,\\\" it reads. \\\"This is a difficult time for me, and I ask for your understanding and privacy.\\u201d\\nThe writer of the statement goes on to promise that they will rectify the situation by refunding patrons, then asks for \\u201ca bit of time to process everything that has happened.\\u201d It\\u2019s signed, simply, \\u201cSincerely\\u201d\\u2014which does not rule out the possibility that it was written by The Unknown.\\nThe original post continues below.\\nIf you stop and think about it, Willy Wonka\\u2019s chocolate factory is an absolutely terrifying place. A lunatic millionaire lures a group of children and their unwitting parents to his massive estate, where they are expected try his non-FDA approved concoctions\\u2014and, one by one, are horribly disfigured in the process.\\nAll that considered, it\\u2019s not terribly surprising that a recent event billed as \\u201cWilly\\u2019s Chocolate Experience\\u201d went terribly, terribly awry. Last weekend, families traveled from all over the UK for what they believed would be an immersive experience in keeping with Roald Dahl\\u2019s beloved children\\u2019s book, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, the source material for the 1971 film Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory and the 2023 prequel Wonka, starring Timoth\\u00e9e Chalamet as the eccentric chocolatier. What they found when they arrived was a scene straight out of the Saw franchise. Children cried. Parents called the police. And the whole thing blew up on social media.\\nSo, what was Willy\\u2019s Chocolate Experience, and how did everything go so wrong, so quickly? VF investigates.\\nFirst of all: What was the experience supposed to be?\\nPut on by London-based event company House of Illuminati, Willy\\u2019s Chocolate Experience was intended to be an immersive, magical activity for children and their families. The event promised attendees a paradise of sweet treats, chocolate fountains, live performances by Oompa Loompas, an appearance by Wonka himself, and \\u201ca celebration of chocolate in all its delightful forms.\\u201d There would be an Enchanted Garden, Twilight Tunnel, and Imagination Lab that, the event\\u2019s website ensured, would captivate and enchant anyone ages three and above.\\nDespite the hype, the advertisements for Willy\\u2019s Chocolate Experience failed to include any actual pictures of the event, instead relying on illustrated images\\u2014which one shrewd Reddit user noticed.\\n\\u201cHas anyone else been getting FB ads for \\u2018Willy\\u2019s Chocolate Experience?\\u2019\\u201d wrote Reddit user, @Prestigious_Try4610, clearly onto the scam. \\u201cEvery image is AI generated along with all the gibberish text it try\\u2019s to create. Not 1 single picture giving people an idea of what they are shelling out money for and yet people are buying up tickets.\\u201d\\n\\u201cIndulge in a Chocolate fantasy like never before,\\u201d read the website. Well, they didn\\u2019t lie about that: Willy\\u2019s Chocolate Experience was certainly unique.\\nWhere did this all go down?\\nGlasgow, Scotland. The Traitors is also filmed in Scotland. Coincidence or omen?\\nAnd what did the venue look like?\\nBleak as all get out. Held at the Box Hub, a warehouse event space in Glasgow, Willy\\u2019s Chocolate Experience contained some shoddily thrown together Wonka\\u2013esque decorations, a handful of circular tables and folding chairs, some AI-printed images to decorate the walls, a smoke machine, and a sparkly rainbow for children to walk under. A world of pure imagination it most certainly was not.\\nIn an interview with The New York Times, attendee Stuart Sinclair described the venue. \\u201cThere was maybe 20 chairs, a couple of tables and a half-inflated bouncy castle,\\u201d said Sinclair, who traveled over two hours to bring his three kids to the event. Tickets cost up to $44 per person.\\nWere there any sweet treats? Any chocolate?\\nNot really, no. According to Sinclair, the children were given \\u201ctwo jelly beans each\\u201d and then a \\u201chalf cup of lemonade.\\u201d To make matters worse, Sinclair said there wasn\\u2019t even any chocolate. Wonka is rolling over in his grave.\\nFor shame. What did the performers have to say about the event?\\nThey were just as gobsmacked as everyone else. Paul Connell, a stand-up comedian who was hired to play Willy himself, took to social media to explain how he got caught up in the whole mess. Per Connell, he was hired a few days before the event, then was handed an \\u201cAI-generated gibberish\\u201d script and told he could \\u201cdo whatever you want.\\u201d Kirsty Paterson, an aspiring actor/fire dancer/yoga instructor who portrayed an Oompah Loompa that went viral, told Vulture she took the job because it offered \\u00a3500 for two days of work. But when she arrived to the dress rehearsal and saw the script, she too had misgivings. \\u201cWhen I got the script the night before I was like, Oh, this is not\\u2026\\u201d Upright Citizens Brigade should have sent a cease and desist letter right then and there.\\nHere\\u2019s a taste of the AI-generated script: \\u201cI had to say, \\u2018There is a man who lives here. His name is not known, so we call him 'The Unknown'. \\u2018The Unknown\\u2019 is an evil chocolate maker who lives in the walls,\\u2019\\u201d said Connell. \\u201cAt the end of my monologue, I was supposed to suck up the unknown man with a vacuum cleaner. I asked them if they had a vacuum cleaner and they said, \\u2018Yeah, we haven\\u2019t really got there yet, so just improvise,\\u2019\\u201d per the Independent. Shakespeare could never.\\nThe costumes were similarly subpar. \\u201cThey were so inappropriate for what it was,\\u201d said Paterson. \\u201cIt was just strange, and they were really cheaply made. It was almost like they were secondhand.\\u201d Jenny Fogarty, who also played an Oompah Loompa, told The Scotsman that \\u201cthe wigs were very cheap. We were just handed an Amazon box that probably arrived that morning.\\u201d Nothing worse than a shake-and-go wig.\\nNevertheless, the professionals persisted, even against their better judgment. \\u201cI was like, I don\\u2019t know if I actually want to do this,\\u201d said Paterson, per Vulture, when she arrived for the gig the next day. \\u201cBut I\\u2019d signed the contract, and part of me didn\\u2019t want to disappoint the kids going to this.\\u201d Similarly, Connell felt bad for the children subjected to Willy\\u2019s Chocolate Experience. \\u201cIt was very disappointing to see how many people turned up at this event and found basically me dressed up as Willy Wonka in a half-abandoned warehouse,\\u201d he said.\\nYikes. What happened at the event?\\nWell, if you can believe it, the patrons were less than pleased. Connell said that the crowd became increasingly agitated as the event wore on. \\u201cIt did turn quite scary at one point, because people were angry,\\u201d he said. \\u201cThere was lots of shouting and groups of people getting very, very irate.\\u201d\\nThe Scottish police told The New York Times that officers were called to the scene after the event was canceled. (It\\u2019s unclear who called them.) Thankfully, it was determined that the police were not needed. It turns out you can\\u2019t arrest someone for providing a shamefully underwhelming event.\\nWhat did the organizers of the event have to say for it?\\nHouse of Illuminati has released the following statement: \\u201cUnfortunately, last minute we were let down in many areas of our event and tried our best to continue on and push through and now realise we probably should have cancelled first thing this morning instead.\\u201d Hindsight is 20/20.\\nHave Roald Dahl\\u2019s estate or Warner Bros. released a statement about the event yet?\\nVanity Fair has reached out for comment, but no, not yet. The event had no affiliation with Roald Dahl\\u2019s estate or Warner Bros. Note that it\\u2019s named after \\u201cWilly\\u201d but not \\u201cWonka.\\u201d\\nClearly, Willy\\u2019s Chocolate Experience made Fyre Festival look like a stay at the White Lotus.

In one city, it was the power of a phony online event listing.\\nHundreds of Dubliners made their way to the city center on Thursday night, excited for a Halloween parade to take place on a mild October evening as they lined up along O\\u2019Connell Street, a major thoroughfare.\\nBut they waited and waited (and waited), and a realization settled in: The parade hadn\\u2019t arrived. The parade was never coming. The parade never even existed.\\nThere was no parade.\\nSo many people had gathered for the nonexistent spectacle that the local police announced on social media around 8 p.m., an hour after the parade was supposed to begin, that no event was planned and asked the crowds to \\u201cdisperse safely.\\u201d\\nIt seemed like the ultimate trick. How were so many people duped into lining up for a treat they didn\\u2019t get, a parade that never was?\\nThe culprit seems to be the website MySpiritHalloween.com, which contains a glut of Halloween event listings, costume tips and game ideas. The site lists Halloween events in multiple places, including in Britain, Ireland and the United States.\\nThat included a parade in Dublin, with a precise location and start time.\\nThe owner of the website, Nazir Ali, said on Friday morning that he had not intended to dupe anybody, claiming the whole thing was a mistake.\\n\\u201cIt was not a joke, not a scam,\\u201d he said. It was \\u201cnot on purpose.\\u201d\\nMr. Ali, who owns at least five other websites, declined to say where he was based, but said that MySpiritHalloween.com used artificial intelligence to generate its content. Humans are involved in the website\\u2019s search engine optimization efforts to ensure it ranks highly on sites like Google, he said, but much of the information is produced by A.I.\\nThe website, he said, compiled information from about 1,400 Halloween events from all over the world. The nonexistent parade in Dublin was said to be put on by Macnas, an Irish theater group that has previously staged parades and held one this year in Galway \\u2014 but not Dublin. (Dublin has hosted Halloween parades in past years, but not in 2024.)\\nThat information was readily available elsewhere on the internet but seems to have been missed by many people who saw or were told about the A.I.-generated content, which was also shared across social media by local people and businesses, The Irish Times reported.\\n\\u201cOn the face of it, it seems strange that people would believe it,\\u201d said Nick Anstead, an associate professor in the Department of Media and Communications at the London School of Economics and Political Science. \\u201cAfter all, not one official confirmed the event was happening.

Afterward, the incident went viral as an example of AI slop seeping into the real world.\\nSince the generative AI boom began, a class of SEO entrepreneurs has started pumping out AI-generated content on websites and across social platforms, in efforts to make money off online advertising and affiliate marketing. MySpiritHalloween.com owner Nazir Ali is one of them. WIRED spoke with Ali via Google Meet to get his side of the story. He insists it\\u2019s all just a big misunderstanding.\\nThis interview has been edited for length and clarity.\\nNazir Ali: Ask anything.\\nKate Knibbs: Well, how are you doing?\\nI am actually good, but we are highly embarrassed. We are highly depressed that everyone is reporting against us. They're calling us scammers, saying that we scammed. This was not on purpose!\\nCan you explain what happened?\\nThe thing is, we are the content creators. I am the owner of a SEO agency. We make websites and we rank them on Google. We hired some content writers online, and they helped us out on all the Halloween events throughout the world: in the USA, in UK, and most importantly, Ireland. If there are any mistakes, for example you see an event and it was moved\\u2014there were some events in Dubai, but hotel management texted us and said that the event was not listed, so we removed it immediately. But no one reported that this one wasn\\u2019t going to happen. As soon as we knew, we changed it. We even wrote this has been canceled, but it was too late.\\nI want to ask about the AI of it all\\u2014\\nI\\u2019ll explain it to you. You can easily write a whole website with AI. But it is not easy to rank on Google\\u2019s first page, and our site was ranked on the first page. It was even on the first position of the first page. Okay, AI was involved. We asked ChatGPT to write the article for us, but it wasn\\u2019t ChatGPT by itself. So we took help from AI, we took help from ChatGPT, but we optimized that ourselves.\\nSo there was a human editor?\\nExactly, yes, we humanized it. Definitely. You cannot rank through AI content alone. AI was involved 10 percent or 20 percent. We were 80 percent involved. And we apologize to our Irish brothers. We are highly disappointed, highly embarrassed, and honestly, we are feeling bad.\\nHow many other websites do you have?\\nI own five websites. And actually, I want to tell you one more thing. Are you familiar with St. Patrick\\u2019s Day?\\nYes.\\nWe wrote a lot of events this year, on the 17th of March, St. Patrick\\u2019s Day\\u2014and they were ranked. People even congratulated us. They thanked us for listing events about St Patrick's Day. No event was reported as bogus, or AI-generated, or anything like that. We try our best to give people authentic content. We don't actually want to mislead any of our Irish brothers. This was just a mistake. And you guys should not say that we are the scammers, unless you actually know it, unless you ask us. This is why I am here to clarify things.\\nI appreciate that.\\nWe own this mistake.\\nSo your name is Nazir Ali, but when you say \\u201cwe\\u201d\\u2014\\nWe are not going to give you any personal information that might be harmful for us. Everyone is writing about us, and they are telling us that we are scammers.\\nWould you be comfortable telling me about the reports that you\\u2019re based in Pakistan? Is that true?\\nWe hire some of the content creators, and one is from Pakistan, and others are from some other countries. But I don't want to actually reveal their nationalities. People will blame the country if I say I'm from Dubai, then whenever you write an article, if you say that a guy from Pakistan, a guy from India, guy from Ireland, a guy from the UAE, it actually hurts some of the citizens of that country.\\nWould you be comfortable telling me how long you\\u2019ve had this Halloween website?\\nYou will be shocked to know that we ranked our site in three months on the Google first page.\\nSo you've only been in operation for three months?\\nYes.\\nWhy holiday events?\\nIt\\u2019s a huge topic, but only for one day. So it is easy for us to generate revenue for that one day\\u2014then we don't have to put in effort throughout the year. We just do work for three or four months, and then we'll get the revenue.\\nCould you explain more about your business model. How do you make money?\\nOur business model is Google Ads. Google Ads and affiliate marketing.\\nHas this made you reconsider the ways that you operate? Will you change how you use AI going forward?\\nIt is our mistake. We should double check it. Not only double, but triple check it. One more thing I want to add is that people should not consider Google as the standard. Google is just a search engine, and any person can post anything on it. Don't just believe it. Just cross check!\\nAre you concerned that Google will downrank you now?\\nDefinitely. We are expecting Google will derank.\\nIs there anything you could try to do to prevent that?\\nNo, there is nothing. And this is because of all the misinformation provided by the journalists. They don't actually know what our intentions are, but they are showing that our intentions are wrong. But right now the guys are very depressed. Listen to me. If we wanted to scam people, we can easily do so by selling fake tickets. But we never mentioned any tickets on the website. That would be very simple, but we didn't even mention the ticket thing.\\nWell, I\\u2019m glad you didn\\u2019t do that.\\nThen we would be scammers, but we don\\u2019t do it, because it is illegal and prohibited.\\nHow much money do you make off SEO?\\nIt is very personal, and it depends on the traffic.\\nBallpark?\\nOne more thing is that we posted around 1,400 articles. It is not easy to post 1,400 articles in three months and to make them rank in Google. This shows that this is a mistake. This is not a scam. We have other articles, we have other websites. We never had this type of issue before.\\nIn addition to the St. Patrick's Day websites, what are some of the other websites you\\u2019re running?\\nActually, there are few others about animals. Another niche is about SEO, and how you can be an SEO expert, but I\\u2019m not going to reveal those.\\nOK. Is there anything else you think people have gotten wrong about you?\\nI just want to say that people should not judge so soon. They should go through some of the processes\\u2014they can contact me, contact our team. They should ask us questions. They can be harsh, they can be rude. But we are not wrong, and we are not scammers.

A key difference is that with OverDrive, librarians can pick and choose which books in OverDrive\\u2019s catalog they want to give their customers the option of borrowing. With Hoopla, librarians have to opt into Hoopla\\u2019s entire catalog, then pay for whatever their customers choose to borrow from that catalog. The only way librarians can limit what Hoopla books their customers can borrow is by setting a limit on the price of books. For example, a library can use Hoopla but make it so their customers can only borrow books that cost the library $5 per use.\\nOn one hand, Hoopla\\u2019s gigantic catalog, which includes ebooks, audio books, and movies, is a selling point because it gives librarians access to more for cheaper price.

Now Activision has admitted to using AI-generated assets in the hit multiplayer shooter on its Steam page.\\nThe developers describe how their game uses AI generated content like this: \\u201cOur team uses generative AI tools to help develop some in game assets,\\u201d reads the disclosure on Valve\\u2019s storefront, recently spotted by CharlieIntel. While it doesn\\u2019t elaborate any further on which assets are made with AI and how, the confession has reaffirmed what some fans had been claiming for months.\\nThe Black Ops 6 slop controversy began last October, a week before the game released, with allegations spreading on YouTube of certain prestige emblems looking AI-generated. A set of sexy vampire calling cards raised red flags again in early November, with fans pointing at different parts of the art that looked oddly rendered.\\nBut the most convincing examples of potential AI slop arrived in early December. Loading screens depicted hands with extra digits, a tell-tale sign of work produced by algorithms built on stealing other artists\\u2019 work, but not knowing how to count. One loading screen included a black glove with six fingers holding billiard balls.\\nThe second was a zombie Santa holding up hand that had six fingers. Both were laughably egregious at the time, but also fostered fears that other less obvious examples might also have been AI-generated. The appearance of the Zombie Santa was even worse in the context of Zombies mode\\u2019s voice actors being replaced amid a SAG-AFTRA strike for greater AI protections in game acting.\\nActivision\\u2019s new disclosure comes after previous reports that developers within the company were encouraged to experiment with new AI tools in their work. A report by Wired claimed an entire paid cosmetic was made with help from AI in 2023's Modern Warfare, after the publisher had greenlit the tools for help with making concept art and marketing materials. That same year, then CEO Bobby Kotick praised the work being done at OpenAI and other companies, suggesting the technology would be as transformative as the original Macintosh computer.\\nNow Activision is owned by Microsoft, which touted the largest launch ever for Black Ops 6 last fall thanks in part to Game Pass, and has itself been moving full-steam ahead with trying to incorporate generative AI into game development. The company recently announced Muse, a model for visualizing gameplay built on data captured from people playing Ninja Theory\\u2019s 2020 PvP game Bleeding Edge. Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer even claimed similar technology would aid in game preservation by making it easier to emulate classics on modern hardware.\\nBut so far, Black Ops 6 has proven generative-AI tools and the current level of quality control around them often can\\u2019t even get simple static images on loading screens right. Fortunately, a new SteamDB tag lets players filters games that us generative-AI out of their store searches.\\n.\", \"source\": \"https://web.archive.org/web/20250530001956/https://kotaku.com/black-ops-6-ai-calling-card-loading-screen-blops-6-cod-1851766313\", \"word_count\": 519, \"sentiments\": [-0.005940355940355941, 0.44330035044320737], \"polarity\": -0.005940355940355941, \"subjectivity\": 0.44330035044320737}, {\"_id\": 38, \"title\": \"PlayStation Exclusive Foamstars Has AI-Generated Art, Square Enix Confirms - IGN\", \"excerpt\": \"The PlayStation exclusive, Splatoon-like shooter Foamstars uses artificial intelligence (AI) generated art, developer Square Enix has revealed.\", \"author\": null, \"source-hostname\": \"IGN\", \"date\": \"2024-01-16\", \"text\": \"The PlayStation exclusive, Splatoon-like shooter Foamstars uses artificial intelligence (AI) generated art, developer Square Enix has revealed.\\nSpeaking to VGC, Foamstars producer Kosuke Okatani confirmed the game \\u2014 which launches into PlayStation Plus on February 6 \\u2014 uses AI-generated art for certain assets, but claimed most of the game is made by actual developers.\\nSquare Enix used controversial AI tool Midjourney, which turns text prompts into visual art, to create in-game album covers for music tracks. \\\"We experimented with Midjourney using simple prompts to produce abstract images,\\\" Square Enix said. \\\"We loved what was created and used them as the final album covers players will see in the game.

Legendary filmmaker Tim Burton called AI generated art \\\"very disturbing\\\" in September 2023 while Wizards of the Coast was forced to issue a correction in January 2024 after claiming it didn't use AI for some Magic: The Gathering artwork when it actually did.\\nSeveral video game voice actors have also rallied against AI, including Grand Theft Auto 5 voice actor Ned Luke who called out a chatbot which used his voice. The Witcher voice actor Doug Cockle also told IGN that AI was \\\"inevitable\\\" but \\\"dangerous\\\", sharing in Luke's assessment that chatbots and similar uses are \\\"effectively robbing [voice actors] of income\\\".\\nEmbark Studios, the developer of smash hit shooter The Finals, was criticised for using AI voiceovers by myriad actors and even other developers, for example. Embark told IGN that \\\"making games without actors isn't an end goal\\\" and claimed it uses a mix of both recorded audio voices and audio generated via AI text to speech tools for its games, however.\\nVideo game voice actors have also called out AI-generated explicit Skyrim mods, and Assassin's Creed Syndicate voice actress Victoria Atkin called AI-generated mods the \\u201cinvisible enemy we're fighting right now\\u201d after discovering her voice was used by cloning software. Paul Eiding, the voice actor behind Colonel Campbell in the Metal Gear Solid series, also condemned its use.\\nLooking to counter chatbots like the Grand Theft Auto one, Cissy Jones, a voice actor known for her roles in Disney's Owl House, Destiny 2: The Witch Queen, Shin Megami Tensei 5, and more, has started a company called Morpheme.ai to let voice actors embrace AI in their own way and gain control of their own voices going forward.\\nRyan Dinsdale is an IGN freelance reporter.

Xbox has partnered with Inworld AI to develop tools for developers to generate AI NPCs, quests, and stories. The Finals, a free-to-play multiplayer shooter, was criticized by voice actors for its use of text-to-speech programs to generate voices. Despite the backlash, the game has a mostly positive rating on Steam and is in the top 20 of most played games on the platform.\\nEarlier this month, SAG-AFTRA signed a deal with Replica Studios, an AI voice software company, that would allow performers to license their voice exclusively with the company for use in video game projects.\\nWhile Foamstars\\u2019 use of AI is centered on images and not voices, Square Enix\\u2019s use of Midjourney to generate the images introduces thorny questions regarding copyright infringement. Midjourney and Stable Diffusion, another popular AI generation tool, are being sued by artists claiming the tools infringe on artists\\u2019 rights because the data the tools are trained on is taken from artists without their consent. There\\u2019s also additional concern that widespread adoption of AI could exacerbate the ongoing video game labor crisis, as it could put humans out of work.\\nA Square Enix PR representative further elaborated on Foamstars\\u2019 use of AI to VGC: \\u201cIn this instance, we experimented with Midjourney using simple prompts to produce abstract images.

       "'Your email inbox is full of spam. Your letterbox is full of junk mail. Now, your web browser has its own affliction: slop.\\n“Slop” is what you get when you shove artificial intelligence-generated material up on the web for anyone to view.\\nUnlike a chatbot, the slop isn’t interactive, and is rarely intended to actually answer readers’ questions or serve their needs.\\nInstead, it functions mostly to create the appearance of human-made content, benefit from advertising revenue and steer search engine attention towards other sites.\\nJust like spam, almost no one wants to view slop, but the economics of the internet lead to its creation anyway. AI models make it trivial to automatically generate vast quantities of text or images, providing an answer to any imaginable search query, uploading endless shareable landscapes and inspirational stories, and creating an army of supportive comments. If just a handful of users land on the site, reshare the meme or click through the adverts hosted, the cost of its creation pays off.\\nBut like spam, its overall effect is negative: the lost time and effort of users who now have to wade through slop to find the content they’re actually seeking far outweighs the profit to the slop creator.\\n“I think having a name for this is really important, because it gives people a concise way to talk about the problem,” says the developer Simon Willison, one of the early proponents of the term “slop”.\\n“Before the term ‘spam’ entered general use it wasn’t necessarily clear to everyone that unwanted marketing messages were a bad way to behave. I’m hoping ‘slop’ has the same impact – it can make it clear to people that generating and publishing unreviewed AI-generated content is bad behaviour.”\\nSlop is most obviously harmful when it is just plain wrong. Willison pointed to an AI-generated Microsoft Travel article that listed the “Ottawa food bank” as a must-see attraction in the Canadian capital as a perfect example of the problem. Occasionally, a piece of slop is so useless that it goes viral in its own right, like the careers advice article that earnestly explains the punchline to a decades-old newspaper comic: “they pay me in woims”.\\n“While the precise meaning of ‘They Pay Me in Woims’ remains ambiguous, various interpretations have emerged, ranging from a playful comment on work-life balance to a deeper exploration of our perceived reality,” the slop begins.\\nAI-generated books have become a problem too. A prominent example came when amateur mushroom pickers were recently warned to avoid foraging books sold on Amazon that appeared to have been written by chatbots and contained dangerous advice for anyone hoping to discern a lethal fungus from an edible one.\\nImage-generated slop has also blossomed on Facebook, as images of Jesus Christ with prawns for limbs, children in plastic bottle-cars, fake dream homes and improbably old women claiming to have baked their 122nd birthday cake garner thousands of shares.\\nJason Koebler of the tech news site 404 Media believes the trend represents what he calls the “zombie internet”. The rise of slop, he says, has turned the social network into a space where “a mix of bots, humans and accounts that were once humans but aren’t any more mix together to form a disastrous website where there is little social connection at all.”\\nNick Clegg, the president of global affairs at Facebook’s parent company, Meta, wrote in February that the social network is training its systems to identify AI-made content. “As the difference between human and synthetic content gets blurred, people want to know where the boundary lies,” he wrote.\\nThe problem has begun to worry the social media industry’s main revenue source: the advertising agencies who pay to place ads next to content. Farhad Divecha, the managing director of UK-based digital marketing agency AccuraCast, says he is now encountering cases where users are mistakenly flagging ads as AI-made slop when they are not.\\n“We have seen instances where people have commented that an advert was AI-generated rubbish when it was not,” he says, adding that it could become a problem for the social media industry if consumers “start to feel they are being served rubbish all the time”.\\nTackling spam in inboxes required an enormous cross-industry effort and led to a fundamental change in the nature of email. Big webmail providers like Gmail aggressively monitor their own platforms to crack down on spammers and are increasingly suspicious of emails arriving from untrusted email servers. They also apply complex, largely undocumented, AI systems to try to detect spam directly, in a constant cat-and-mouse game with the spammers themselves.\\nFor slop, the future is less rosy: the world’s largest companies have gone from gamekeeper to poacher. Last week, Google announced an ambitious plan to add AI-made answers to the top of some search results, with US-based users the first to experience a full rollout of the “AI Overviews” feature. It will include links as well, but users who want to limit the response to just a selection of links to other websites will be able to find them – by clicking through to “web” on the search engine, demoted to sit beside “images” and “maps” on the list of options.\\n“We’ve added this after hearing from some that there are times when they’d prefer to just see links to webpages in their search results,” wrote Danny Sullivan, the company’s search liaison.\\nGoogle says the AI overviews have strong safety guardrails. Elsewhere on the web though, slop is spreading.'"
